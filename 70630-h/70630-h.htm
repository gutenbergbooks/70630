</div>


<p>Many influences have conditioned the teaching of history
in the public schools—local and national, statutory and
constitutional, ephemeral and enduring, religious, educational,
racial and patriotic.</p>

<p>It is the purpose of this study to give an historical account
of some of the attempts to control the teaching of
history in the public schools. The first four chapters trace
the legislative control that has been exerted in all periods
of our history, beginning with the educational enactments
of the early colonies and following the development of the
curriculum to the present time.</p>

<p>Such statutory control falls into fairly definite periods.
The first embraces the earliest statutes relating to public
education. During this period history was introduced into
the school curriculum as a separate subject specified by
law. The next stage, 1860 to 1900, was characterized by
the influences set in motion by the Civil War and the
Economic Revolution. In the years from 1900 to 1917,
the history curriculum reflected the new interest of the
American people in the social and economic conditions that
had developed. From 1917 to the present, the dominant
note has been a dynamic patriotism growing out of the
World War.</p>

<p>Besides the legislative aspects of the subject, I have
endeavored to set forth the propagandist influences on
textbook-making exerted by religious, patriotic, racial and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
other organized groups. Within the last five years attention
to an unprecedented degree has been focused upon
history and its allied subjects. Although much interest has
been attached to the agitation carried on since the World
War, similar movements marked earlier periods. A chapter
on Disloyalty Charges against Teachers since 1917 has been
included as pertinent to the discussion in general.</p>

<p>Because of their kinship with history, the other social
studies have been considered. The term <i>social studies</i> has
been used to embrace history, economics, government and
sociology. Geography has not been included, because it
but recently acquired a place in the curriculum as a social
study. More attention, furthermore, has been paid to the
subject of history, since it has been the chief social study
in the public school curriculum. There has been no attempt
to portray the extent to which laws have been enforced.
Throughout it has been my desire to narrate
without partiality or prejudice the facts relating to the
subject under discussion.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this volume I am indebted to many
friends for advice and coöperation in obtaining material.
In the search for present-day conditions I have drawn
heavily upon many correspondents including school superintendents,
textbook authors and publishers, as well as
those engaged in criticising school histories. To all who
have aided, I would here express my sincere gratitude. I
have particularly profited by the guidance and constructive
criticism of Professor Arthur M. Schlesinger of Harvard
University, who first called the subject to my attention, and
who is chiefly responsible for whatever merit there is in this
study. I am indebted for many helpful suggestions to
Professor Ernest Horn of the University of Iowa, to Professor
Carl Wittke of Ohio State University, and to Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
Richard J. Purcell of the Catholic University of America.
These acknowledgments would not be complete without
mentioning my obligation to my sister, Anne E. Pierce, for
assistance at all stages in the preparation of the manuscript,
and to my mother, whose spirit of coöperation has proved
a constant source of inspiration.</p>

<p>Statutory prescriptions of history as a specific subject in
the American public school had their beginning in the years
between 1827 and 1860; yet the way for such enactments
had been charted by earlier educational legislation. For
example, in 1642 the Massachusetts Puritans provided that
every child be taught enough “to read and understand the
principles of religion and the capital laws of the country,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and returning to the subject in 1647, expressed their belief
that education would serve to “thwart that auld deluder
Sathan” whose “cheife project [was] to keep men from
ye knowledge of ye Scriptures.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In the course of time it was natural that the function of
education should enlarge. From the religious conception
inevitably sprang a belief in education as a means of imparting
an understanding of the principles of “right living.”
The individual as a virtuous, polite, and exemplary force
in the community became the objective of the lawmaker.
Closely allied with this conviction was a faith in education
as an instrument for teaching patriotism and for training
in the fundamentals of government. Thus, in 1732, New
York justified the establishment of her schools on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
ground that “good Learning is not only a very great
Accomplishment but the properest Means to Attain Knowledge,
Improve the Mind, Morality and good Manners and
to make Men better, wiser and more useful to their Country
as well as to themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In 1780 Massachusetts took a similar stand,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> perceiving
in her schools a method of directing the masses in the great
undertaking of self-government,—a function recognized by
Washington, John Adams, Jefferson and other men of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
day.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Other commonwealths also accepted education as a
means to “preserve and perfect a Republican Constitution”
and to “secure the blessings of liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>These early laws thus paved the way for those of a later
time. They laid the foundation of an education directed
toward the development of civic efficiency. Yet their influence
was circumscribed by the virtual absence of free,
public schools. This lack, however, the second quarter of
the nineteenth century was destined to remedy; for such
was the democratic awakening of the ’twenties and ’thirties
that nearly every field of human activity was transformed.
Trade associations attested a quickened consciousness in
the laboring man; reform movements bore testimony to a
new social point of view; and an aroused electorate chose
for the highest office of the land that exponent of democracy,
Andrew Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>In the states outside of New England little had been
accomplished in the early years of the century toward the
establishment of tax-supported schools. With the extension
of manhood suffrage, however, came the realization that the
functions of government were safe only in the hands of an
enlightened electorate—a conviction which had come only
after much agitation and bitter argument. Gradually and
inevitably the public school, supported by public funds, became
the embodiment of the democratic ideal in which
“intelligence is the grand condition.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The year 1827 signalized the entrance of United States
history into the school curriculum as a study required by
law. At this time both Massachusetts and Vermont made
the teaching of national history compulsory. The Massachusetts
law provided that “every town, containing five
hundred families or householders, shall maintain a school
to be kept by a master of competent ability and good
morals, who shall ... give instruction in the history of
the United States, book-keeping, surveying, geometry, and
algebra; and such last mentioned school shall be kept for
the benefit of all the inhabitants of the town, ten months
at least, exclusive of vacations each year ...; and in
every town containing four thousand inhabitants, the said
master shall, in addition to all the branches of instruction
before required in this chapter be competent to instruct in
the Latin and Greek languages, and history, rhetoric and
logic.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Vermont statute, designed for the elementary
school, required that “each organized town in this state
shall keep and support a school or schools, provided with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
teacher or teachers, of good morals, for the instruction of
youths in ... the history of the United States, and good
behavior.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Counterparts of these laws presently appeared in other
states. In 1846 New Hampshire prescribed history as a
subject in high schools,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and shortly after it was sanctioned
by Rhode Island.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In 1857 the Massachusetts legislature
placed United States history in her elementary schools, and
added general history, the “civil polity” of the commonwealth
and political economy to the required subjects for
high schools.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Three years later, she again committed herself
in favor of the social studies in the curriculum. “In
every town,” the law read, “there shall be kept for at least
six months in each year, a sufficient number of schools for
the instruction of all the children ... in orthography,
reading, writing, English grammar, geography, arithmetic,
the history of the United States and good behavior....”
This law further required in every town of five hundred
families or householders the maintenance of a school in
which instruction in general history and the “civil polity”
of the commonwealth and of the United States should
be given,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and also permitted the teaching of political
economy.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>The South did not awaken to the needs of public education
at this early period because of its institutional and
economic development. Virginia was the only state of that
section to enact legislation relating to the teaching of history
before the Civil War. In 1849 she provided that in
district schools “shall be thoroughly taught, ... history,
especially that of the United States and of Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>None of the states of the Middle West followed the
example set by Massachusetts and Vermont in 1827; but
California, still in a pioneer stage of development, required
instruction in the federal and state constitutions in her
grammar schools, as well as political economy in the high
schools.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This provision constitutes one of the first attempts
by statute to place the subject of government in
the curriculum, although several of the older states had at
an early time emphasized the necessity of a knowledge of
the state law.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In fact, such was the lack of systematic
instruction in “political morals” at this time, that foreign
travelers commented upon it, and Harriet Martineau stigmatized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
it as “an enormous deficiency in a republic,” where
participation in government was a birthright of all.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>By 1860, only six states had passed laws requiring the
teaching of the social studies. To the east lay Massachusetts,
Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island; to the
south, Virginia; and to the far west, California. To the
first requirement of United States history had been added
provisions necessitating the presentation of general history,
political economy and civil government, and Virginia had
prescribed a study of the history of the state.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It was not
until after the Civil War that history acquired a real place
in the public school curriculum.</p>


<h4>THE CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS</h4>

<p>The interest awakened in public education led also to
the passage of laws for the certification of teachers. Often
legislation of this type indirectly describes the character of
the curriculum, for, in general, the teacher was examined
in those subjects which he was expected to teach. At an
early time, the chief qualifications for teachers seemed to
be “good morals” and “competency,” but with the expansion
of the curriculum, there were added, in many cases,
specifically named subjects.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Thus a Connecticut law of 1841 provided that “the
board of visitors [of the schools] ... shall ... examine
all candidates for teachers ... and shall give to these persons
with whose moral character, literary attainments, and
ability to teach, they are satisfied, a certificate, setting forth
the branches he or she is found capable of teaching; provided
that no certificate shall be given to any person not
found qualified to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and
grammar, thoroughly, and the rudiments of geography and
history.”<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In 1857 in the <i>Revisions</i> of their laws, Maine
and Rhode Island specified a knowledge of history as a
necessary qualification for a teacher.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Illinois, in her <i>Revised
Statutes</i> of 1845, included a law which made it the
duty of the school commissioner to examine “any persons
proposing to teach a common school, in any township in
his county,” on the candidate’s ability to teach the usual
branches, including “the history of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>In 1846, during the period of her earliest legislation,
Iowa prescribed the history of the United States as a requirement
for a teacher’s license. This state is an example
of those states which have passed little legislation defining
the content of the curriculum, but have secured the same
end by specifying subjects for the examination of their
teachers. The law appeared again in the <i>Code</i> of 1851,
but history was dropped from the required list of subjects
in 1858.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Legislation in Nebraska took much the same
course as had that in Iowa. In 1855, the territorial laws
placed United States history among the subjects required
in a teacher’s examination, but the laws of 1856 ignored it
as a prescribed subject.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<h4>THE CURRICULUM</h4>

<p>The Civil War marked a turning point in American
history. Forces undreamed of before 1860 conspired to
change the whole tenor of American life. From isolated
rural communities of simple tastes and unexploited resources,
the United States emerged into a growing urbanization
of multifarious activities. Prior to 1860 there had
been little change from the days of George Washington,
when nine-tenths of the people had been engaged in agriculture;
by 1890, however, the population had so shifted
that more than one-third dwelt in towns of over two
thousand inhabitants.</p>

<p>These vast and far-reaching changes were brought about
by an expansion particularly in the fields of transportation,
agriculture, and manufacturing. Steam, electricity, progress
in invention, the growth of an immigrant population,
and the opening of new lands to settlement, all served as
contributing factors. It was a period characterized by a
strong national sentiment. The theory of state rights had
been settled forever by the victory of the Union in 1865,
and a realization of the great opportunities of America bore
the fruit of patriotic fervor. Nationalism expressed itself
in the nationalization of industry, in the organization of
national labor units, in the nationalization of the financial
resources of the country, and in a deepened interest in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
public school system. It led inevitably to a new appreciation
of the distinctive contributions of local communities
to the new national spirit, and was, in a sense, responsible
for a strong reaction toward deep-seated local interests in
the ’nineties.</p>

<p>These vast changes necessitated new aims and purposes
in education. The preceding period had witnessed the
educational system transformed from an instrument of the
church into one of the state. By 1860 the theory of tax-supported
schools had become established, and most states
provided at least elementary instruction. By 1880, legal
and legislative objections to the establishment of high
schools had succumbed to the conviction that education was
essential in the new social and industrial order. There
came to be an abiding faith in the power of education
to regenerate society. The “knowledge aim” of the
preceding decades was followed by the desire for a
citizenship trained to active participation in the society
of which it was the warp and woof. As a result, those
subjects in the curriculum tending to promote patriotism
and good citizenship received the sanction of the educator.</p>

<p>Although history had been found to some extent in the
school curriculum before the Civil War, there had been no
general acceptance of it as a required study.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Now in the
form of United States history it was received with widespread
approval. A gradual extension of the requirements
grew out of the spirit of the times, and to American history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
was added the study of the constitution of the nation and
of the state, as well as the study of state history. Twenty-three
states, during the four decades following 1860, placed
upon their statute books laws requiring the teaching of
history in the public schools. Over one-fourth of these
commonwealths lay below the Mason and Dixon line, the
states of the Middle and Far West becoming the most active
after 1880.</p>

<p>In 1862, Vermont, in a law dealing with “the instruction
of the young,” prescribed history and the constitution of
the United States, and special instruction in “the geography,
and history, constitution and principles of government
of the state of Vermont” as a part of the school curriculum.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
A later law extended the social studies curriculum,
for towns of twenty-five hundred inhabitants, to embrace
political economy, general history, and civil government in
the high school course.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The nearby state of Connecticut
included in her law, regarding the branches to be taught
in her schools, the subject of “history,” later specifying
“United States history.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>During the early years of the period Southern legislatures
were particularly active, both in the border states and in
the Confederacy. In each case the legislation was responsive
to the nationalistic tendencies of the time; and, in the
states of the Confederacy, the study of national history and
of the federal constitution were for the first time required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
by law.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Such statutes, sometimes enacted before the restoration
of home rule and under the influence of Reconstruction
agencies, sought, through the public schools, to
overcome the intensified sectionalism of the post-war South.
Laws making it a duty of the teacher to inculcate a proper
attitude toward “the laws and government of the country”
had much the same purpose as those requiring specifically
the study of United States history and government. Thus
a law of the first legislative assembly of West Virginia,
passed December 10, 1863, made it the duty of all public
school teachers “to inculcate the duties of piety, morality
and respect for the laws and government of their country.”
All teachers and boards of education were expressly
“charged with the duty of providing that moral training
for the youth of this state which shall contribute to securing
good behavior and virtuous conduct, and to furnishing
the state with exemplary citizens.” In 1874, a statute designed
for the primary schools of the state prescribed the
teaching of the common school subjects including geography
and history.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Similar enactments were passed by Missouri and Maryland
in 1865. In Missouri, it was provided that “all
teachers, when employed shall be required to instruct their
pupils in the fundamental principles of the Government of
the United States and of the State of Missouri, and the
duties of loyal citizens thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Maryland, in 1865, made
it a duty of her teachers to train their pupils in piety and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
justice, loyalty and sacred regard for truth, and in love of
country; and to lead them into a clear understanding of the
virtues which were the basis upon which was founded a
republican constitution; “to preserve the blessings of liberty,
promote temporal happiness and advance the greatness
of the American Nation.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The study of United
States history was likewise required, followed in 1868 by
the subject of government, both federal and state. It was
not until a few years later that state history was added to
the prescribed list.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Among the first of the states of the Confederacy to enact
laws requiring the teaching of United States history were
Arkansas, South Carolina and Mississippi.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Passed during
the period of carpet-bag control, their statutes show plainly
the effects of reconstruction influences. The Arkansas law
of 1868 and South Carolina’s law of 1870 prescribed not
only the study of national history but also required a
knowledge of the principles of the federal and state constitutions.
In 1881, North Carolina enacted a statute for
the teaching of both national and state history, and Tennessee,
in 1873, accorded a place to United States history
among the subjects required in her schools.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It was not
until later that the Alabama <i>Code</i> records similar action by
the legislature of that state in prescribing instruction in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
“the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution
of the State of Alabama” for “all pupils in all schools and
colleges supported, in whole or in part, by public money,
or under state control.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Among the border states, Kentucky, as well as West
Virginia, called for the teaching of history, to which was
added the study of civil government after “July 1, 1889.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Florida reverted to a form of the morality laws for the
promotion of citizenship through the public schools. In
1881, she directed and authorized each teacher “to labor
faithfully and earnestly for the advancement of pupils in
their studies, deportment and morals, and to embrace every
opportunity to inculcate by precept and example, the principles
of truth, honesty, patriotism, and the practice of every
Christian virtue; to require the pupils to observe personal
cleanliness, neatness, order, promptness, and gentility of
manners, to avoid vulgarity and profanity, and to cultivate
in them habits of industry and economy, a regard for the
rights and feelings of others, and their own responsibilities
and duties as citizens.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In 1889 there was added another
duty to the list enumerated above: that of “reading at least
once a month the Declaration of Rights as set forth by the
constitution of the state of Florida.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>The states of the Middle West also desired to inculcate
patriotism in the youth of that section and to emphasize the
accomplishments of America. In a series of laws, beginning
in 1861, Minnesota prescribed the study of the “history
of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In 1878, she sought to carry out
the desire for an exemplary citizenry in “An Act to introduce
Moral and Social Science in the Public Schools of the
State,” in which was reëchoed the sentiment of the morality
laws of a former time.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>By 1876, Wisconsin had allied herself with those endorsing
the study of government, by prescribing that “the constitution
of the United States and of this state shall be
taught in every district school.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> By later laws the study
of United States history and civil government was required.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Among the subjects prescribed in Indiana and Missouri
was United States history, the latter state directing that
elementary school pupils before entering the high school
must have completed the subject.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> South Dakota, in 1895,
made United States history a requirement of her common
school curriculum,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and North Dakota by a series of laws
sanctioned both United States history and civil government.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Before statehood had been achieved, the territory
of Dakota had prescribed, in 1883, that “the highest standard
of morals shall be taught, and industry, truthfulness,
integrity, and self-respect inculcated, obedience to law enjoined,
and the aims of an upright and useful life cultivated.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
The same purpose was evident in North Dakota’s
law of 1890 and that of South Dakota of 1893, which
provided for “moral instruction tending to impress
upon the minds of pupils the importance of truthfulness,
temperance, purity, public spirit, patriotism, and respect
for honest labor, obedience to parents and due deference
for old age, shall be given by each teacher in the public
schools.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The states of the Far West were likewise active. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
followed in the wake of the older states by prescribing, in
most cases, the teaching of United States history, and in
some instances the study of government. In addition, they
reverted to the type of law found at an early time in the
Eastern states, which required a teacher to instruct in the
principles of a free government “to train them [the pupils]
up to a true comprehension of the rights, duties, and dignity
of American citizenship.” Both types of law are found in
the legislation of Washington,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Montana,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> California,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and
Arizona.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Nevada and New Mexico allied themselves with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the movement to teach United States history in the public
schools.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Utah also prescribed United States history as a part of
the school curriculum and included in another law an admonition
for instruction in patriotism.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This statute is a
good example of the evolutionary stage through which most
states passed in the making of laws, and shows the tendency
of the newer states to revert to the old type of laws in the
early period of statehood. In Idaho no content subject was
prescribed by law, but the teacher was held responsible for
inculcating the “principles of morality, truth, justice, and
patriotism.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The place of history in the school curriculum was thus
thoroughly established by law at the close of the nineteenth
century. United States history was required in more statutes
than any other field of history, although, in some instances,
political economy and general history found a place
in the high school program. Frequently added to the requirement
of national history, was the study of civil government,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
both federal and state, and occasionally local or state
history.</p>

<p>During the period one-third of the legislatures enacting
social study laws prescribed the teaching of the federal
constitution. A knowledge of the state constitution was
required in Maryland, South Carolina, Alabama, Missouri,
and Arkansas; and North Carolina and Maryland, besides
Vermont, prescribed the teaching of state history. The
emphasis placed upon a knowledge of state institutions was
but the reaction from the intense nationalism of the years
immediately following the Civil War. It was especially
evident toward the close of the century and during the early
years following 1900. Indeed, from 1880 to 1900 local pride
evinced a quickened consciousness in the organization of
such groups as the Sons of Veterans in 1881, the United
Confederate Veterans and the Sons of the American Revolution
in 1889, the Daughters of the American Revolution in
1890, and the Sons of Confederate Veterans in 1896. In
literature, writers like Cable, Eggleston, Harte and Stockton
glorified the characteristics peculiar to their localities;
and laws relating to the public school curriculum reflected
precisely the same temper.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Educational and learned societies likewise bore testimony
to the interest in the study of history. In 1876, a committee
of the National Education Association recommended United
States history for the elementary school and a study of
“universal history and the Constitution of the United States
for high schools.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In 1892, the Committee of Ten was
created by the same organization to consider “programs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the secondary schools in the United States and ... the
requirements for admission to college.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Eight years of
history were asked by this committee, four for the high
school and four for the elementary.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In 1896, the Committee
of Seven of the American Historical Association was
appointed, and in 1899 recommended a four years’ course
in history.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> During this time colleges also extended their
entrance credits to include more history, which, with the
committee reports, aided much in increasing the offerings
in the public school curriculum. These activities are an
indication of the place that history was coming to hold in
the education of the young. They are added proof of the
attention which the public was giving to the social studies
in a period in which twenty-five states passed laws to include
them in a required course of study.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>


<h4>CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS</h4>

<p>During the decade of the ’sixties laws regarding the
certification of teachers were passed by New Hampshire,
Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Maryland, Wisconsin, Indiana,
Missouri, Arkansas, and California. “History” was a requirement
of New Hampshire, Minnesota and Maryland,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span><a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and “United States history” received mention in the laws
of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas,
and California.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> To the requirement of United States
history, California added that of the “Constitution and
Government of the United States,” which was further amplified
by a requirement for the teaching of the constitution of
California, in an amendment of 1874.</p>

<p>From 1870 to 1880 there was little departure from the
subjects required in the preceding period, “history” being
considered essential in Idaho by a law of 1870, by Arkansas,
in 1873 and in 1875, and by West Virginia in 1874 and in
1879 for primary school certificates.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In Texas, Washington,
Kansas, Colorado, and Delaware, the law specified
United States history, and in Oregon, modern history.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span><a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Besides history being required in the statute of Arkansas,
an applicant for a state certificate was required to have a
knowledge of the constitution of the state and nation, an
innovation in the required list of subjects.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In Wisconsin,
the law pertaining to the certification of teachers was revised
in 1879 for the express purpose of examining persons in the
federal and state constitutions, and was carried over in the
statutes of the next thirty years.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>In the decade following 1880, New York, Michigan,
the Dakotas, Alabama, Arizona, Ohio, and Montana joined
the states which had prescribed certification requirements
in the previous decade.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Upon the statute books of Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
Indiana, California, and Washington were continued laws
previously enacted.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> To her requirement of United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
history, Colorado prescribed a knowledge of the federal
constitution.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Civil government, as well as United States
history, was required for licensing in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, the Dakotas, Alabama, Montana, and Arizona.
In Idaho, by a law of 1884, territorial certificates could be
secured only by those showing proficiency not only in United
States history, but in general history, political economy, and
civil government as well.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Oregon also extended her requirements
beyond those commonly found, to include modern
history.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>From 1890 to 1900 only four states passed laws of this
character for the first time. All other legislation of the
period was enacted by states which had previously prescribed
the subjects prerequisite for a teacher’s license. In
those commonwealths where there had been statutes enacted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the list of required subjects was frequently extended to
include political economy.</p>

<p>Florida, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, in prescribing
that their teachers must show a satisfactory knowledge of
United States history, followed the usual practice, although
acting for the first time. To this requirement was added
also that of a knowledge of civil government, a common
prerequisite whose popularity had been established in the
’eighties.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Florida, however, for the third and second grade
certificates did not require a knowledge of civil government,
reserving that only for the first grade and state licenses.
For the latter, a knowledge of general history was required
by the law of 1893.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Wyoming required not only United
States history and civil government, but for a first grade
certificate added political economy.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>From 1890 to 1900 Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Texas, Idaho,
Washington, Utah, California, and Wyoming required proficiency
in United States history and civil government for
some grade of teacher’s license.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>In 1891, Alabama added to the requirement of United
States history for a first grade license, the constitution of
the state of Alabama and of the United States, thereby
conforming to the popular tendency.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> A knowledge of
state history was required in Pennsylvania, Mississippi,
South Dakota and Texas; and Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Minnesota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming required
general history for the higher grade of certification.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
Political economy became a prerequisite for a professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
state certificate in Minnesota by the laws of 1893, in Iowa
in 1896, and in Wyoming in 1899 for a first grade license.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>United States history only was required in Utah for
county certificates of the grammar and primary grades, in
Kansas for the second and third grade certificates, in Indiana
for common school licenses, and in Arkansas for
county certificates.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>During the period from 1860 to 1900 thirty-six states
enacted laws relating to the certification of teachers. Of
this number, only six states had passed laws prior to 1860.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
In all states a knowledge of United States history was a
prerequisite for licensing throughout the period, and, in
most cases, civil government was required.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>


<h4>TEACHERS’ QUALIFICATIONS: OATHS OF LOYALTY</h4>

<p>The fear of an apostacy on the part of the teaching craft
led legislatures in this period to impose other than scholastic
requirements upon those who would teach in the public
schools. These regulations, indicating a distrust of the
loyalty of teachers, have required oaths of allegiance from
all who would qualify as teachers.</p>

<p>Legislation of this character was originally an outgrowth
of the Civil War, the first laws being passed in 1862.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> And
it is not strange that the border state Kentucky was a
pioneer in statutes of this character. Here the law was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
made to apply to all school commissioners, examiners of
teachers for the common schools, and school trustees and
teachers elected to teach in the common schools, all presidents,
professors and teachers in colleges, and high schools
incorporated by legislative enactment. It pledged loyalty
to the Union and denounced the tenets of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>“I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution
of the United States, and the Constitution of Kentucky,”
vowed the applicant, “and be true and faithful to the
commonwealth as long as I remain a citizen thereof. That
I recognize the binding obligations of the Constitution of
the United States and the duty of every citizen to submit
thereto as the supreme law of the land. That I will not give
aid to the rebellion against the government of the United
States, nor give aid to the so-called provisional government
of Kentucky, either directly or indirectly, so long as I remain
a citizen of or reside in Kentucky, and that this oath
is taken by me without any mental reservation—so help
me God.” This oath, given in writing, was kept at the
county court office where the school was located, and a
violation of the oath or false swearing upon conviction, led
to the imposition of a penalty. Evasion of the law, too,
was subject to punishment through a fine of not less than
twenty-five dollars nor more than two hundred dollars.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
In 1889 it was made incumbent upon the county superintendent
to administer such oaths.</p>

<p>Similar laws appeared on the statute books of West
Virginia and Missouri, where, like Kentucky, these border
states felt a pressing need for a loyal citizenry. On December
10, 1863, the former commonwealth declared that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
no applicant should be admitted to an examination for a
teacher’s license unless the county superintendent had
reasonable evidence that the candidate was not only “of
good moral character and temperate habits,” but that he
was “loyal to the government of the United States and of
West Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> To buttress this law it was prescribed
that all teachers should take the oath of loyalty required
of all state officers. The latter regulation was operative
after November 16, 1863, but no specific mention was made
of teachers subscribing to such an oath until 1867. However,
it seems probable that they, as well as state officers,
affirmed their loyalty at the earliest period of statehood,
since it is recorded that two teachers, J. B. Soloman and
C. T. Wilson, in 1869, were exempted from subscribing to
the oath prescribed in the act of 1863.</p>

<p>A statute, moreover, directly prescribed for teachers in
1867 the taking of the following oath: “I, A. A. B., do
solemnly swear that I will support the constitution of the
United States and the constitution of the state of West
Virginia, that I have never voluntarily borne arms against
the United States, that I have voluntarily given no aid or
comfort to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto, by
countenancing, counseling or encouraging them in the same,
that I have not sought, accepted, nor attempted to exercise
the functions of any office whatever under any authority in
hostility to the United States; that I have not yielded a
voluntary support to any pretended government, authority,
power or constitution within the United States, hostile or
inimical thereto; and that I take this obligation freely,
without any mental reservations or purpose of evasion.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The cessation of armed hostilities between the North and
the South induced Missouri to require an avowal of loyalty
on the part of her teachers. On March 29, 1866, there
was approved a law by which “all teachers before entering
upon the discharge of their duties should take and
subscribe to the oath of loyalty prescribed by the constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>Regarding the lessons of the War, Arkansas, in 1866, believed
there should be no disagreement. Here not only did
the applicant for a teacher’s certificate swear to support
the constitution and laws of the United States and Arkansas,
but he also promised that he would encourage all others to
do likewise. “... I will never countenance or aid in the
secession of this state from the United States,” the affirmant
declared, and added his pledge “to inculcate in the minds
of youth sentiments of patriotism and loyalty.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Oregon also required a pledge of her teachers by legislation
in 1862. Before the county superintendent of schools,
disloyalty to the state and nation must be forsworn by the
applicant for a certificate, who promised “without any
mental reservation or evasion whatever,” that he would
“bear true allegiance and fidelity to the same against all
enemies, foreign or domestic.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Dissentient opinions received scant courtesy in Rhode
Island at the time of the Civil War although no law forbade
them. However, a warning from the state commissioner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
education to the general assembly at the January session
of 1865 undoubtedly evoked the same response as the enactment
of a law. Here, too, there was to be no tolerance for
a passive loyalty. “The war tocsin has sounded,” the report
declared, “our country is convulsed in mighty conflict, our
friends are in the contesting field, their blood has been made
to redden and fertilize the rebel soil.... Traitors and
rebel sympathizers are <i>among us</i>, rendering every available
assistance and using every means within their power to
further the rebel cause and aid them in the accomplishment
of their hellish design. Therefore, let us be on our guard,
lest some of them unawares be ushered into our schools as
teachers. For if the teacher be a traitor, his actions will
correspond therewith, and by example, if not by precept,
he will be sowing the seeds of rebellion in the susceptible
hearts of our children. Should the pure minds of our little
ones be poisoned with the damnable principles of rebellion,
or be led astray by the pernicious examples of rebel sympathizers?
Shall the hand already stained with the blood of
the murdered father, be employed to guide his orphan child?—the
hand that applied the lighted torch, and made the
orphan a homeless wanderer, shall that be the hand to trace
the chart by which his little bark is to be guided to its
destined haven? <i>No, most assuredly, no.</i> Better by far
remain as he is, his untutored mind wrapped up in ignorance,
than to be thus guided and piloted by the vile traitor,
only to be finally dashed against the rocks and engulfed in
the waves of rebellion. But let our teachers be noble, loyal
sons and daughters of America—those who, while instructing
our little ones in the sciences that pertain to the secular
concerns of life, will also teach them their obligations to
their country, and at the same time will point them to that
<i>never fading star</i> by which their frail barks may be safely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
guided over life’s treacherous seas to the port of eternal rest,
to gain that blood-washed throng who chant the praises of
God and the Lamb from Mount Zion’s balmy top.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>As a survival of the legislation regarding teachers’ qualifications,
which had been brought about by the period of
Reconstruction, were the statutes of Arizona of 1883 and
1885. By these laws it was made a duty of the superintendent
of public instruction and the county superintendents
of schools to administer oaths and affirmations of loyalty
to teachers.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>


<h4>CITIZENSHIP AS A QUALIFICATION FOR TEACHERS</h4>

<p>Beginning in 1899 came legislation eliminating from the
teaching profession those who were not American citizens.
North Dakota was the pioneer in this movement in a statute
prohibiting the issuance of certificates or permits to teach
to persons not citizens of the United States, unless they had
resided in the United States “for at least one year prior to
the time of such applications or permit.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The same year
Idaho adopted a similar restriction, by forbidding the granting
of certificates or the employment of any teacher in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
public schools, “not a citizen of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> A
decade later (1907) Nevada attempted to promote patriotism
by requiring an oath of all public officials including
teachers in schools and university professors. In this was
affirmed the dominance of the national over the state government
and an abjuration of duelling, a relic of frontier
conditions.</p>

<p>“I, ——, do solemnly swear,” declared the official, or
teacher, “that I will support, protect and defend the Constitution
and Government of the United States and the
Constitution and Government of the State of Nevada against
all enemies, whether domestic or foreign, and that I will
bear true faith, allegiance and loyalty to the same, any state
convention or legislature to the contrary notwithstanding;
and further that I do this, with a full determination, pledge
and purpose, without any mental reservation or evasion
whatsoever. And I do further solemnly swear (or affirm)
that I have not fought a duel, nor sent or accepted a challenge
to fight a duel, nor been a second to either party, nor
in any manner aided or assisted in such a duel, nor been
knowingly the bearer of such challenge or acceptance, since
the adoption of the Constitution of the State of Nevada, and

<h4>TEXTBOOK LEGISLATION</h4>

<p>Substantially all legislation regarding history textbooks
has developed since the Civil War, only three states passing
statutes of this character before 1860.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This form of
regulation falls, in general, into laws in which certain textbooks
are named as suitable for use or are definitely prescribed,
laws in which the subjects of the curriculum are
enumerated by a statement concerning textbooks, enactments
limiting the price of books, statutes by which books
of a partisan or political bias are forbidden, and laws prescribing
the character of the content for history textbooks,
whose source is a sectional or partisan animus.</p>

<p>In 1862, the state of Vermont passed <i>An Act directing
the Board of Education to select a Textbook of the Geography
and History of Vermont</i> which was to be used in all
district schools of the state for a period of five years.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Ten years later Hall’s <i>Geography and History of Vermont</i>,
which was then in use by sanction of the law, was continued
as a textbook until 1878.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> In Rhode Island, the report of
the Superintendent of Public Education, in 1865, named the
histories written by Berard and Goodrich as those commonly
used in the public schools.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> By legislative enactment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
North Carolina in 1879, designated Moore’s <i>History of
North Carolina</i> for use in her public schools.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>Of the textbooks prescribed in West Virginia, Goodrich’s
<i>Common School History</i>, Quackenbos’ <i>History of the
United States</i>, and Holmes’ <i>History of the United States</i>
were named by laws in 1868 and 1873. Later the price of
Myers’ <i>General History</i>, Montgomery’s <i>General History</i>
and Montgomery’s <i>Beginner’s American History</i> were regulated
by law.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In Virginia “the two works of John
Esten Cooke, entitled respectively ‘Virginia: A History of
Her People,’ and ‘Stories of the Old Dominion,’” were
included in the list of textbooks selected.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> In Indiana, in
1889, the state board of education was directed to choose
a history equal to Thalheimer’s <i>History of the United
States</i>,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and two years later it was enacted that the price
of the textbook on the history of the United States should
not exceed 65 cents a volume.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>Minnesota, Kansas, and Montana insisted that their
histories be the equal of Barnes’ <i>School Histories</i>.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
Kansas the law also made it conditional that the civil government
textbook be equal to Thummel’s <i>Government of the
United States with the Kansas addendum</i>,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> and that among
the textbooks selected by the state commission should be
included books on general history, history of Kansas and
English history.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> A Montana law also limited the price
to be paid for books: Barnes’ <i>Brief History of the United
States</i>, retail price $1.20; Barnes’ <i>Primary History of the
United States</i>, retail price 70 cents; and Lovell’s <i>Civics for
Young People</i> (also a prescribed textbook), retail price 50
cents.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> In South Dakota the maximum price for a textbook
on the history of the United States was fixed at 80 cents
by a law of 1891.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The duty of choosing textbooks was delegated to various
officials in the different states. Missouri directed, in 1897,
that a state commission should select the textbooks in
United States history and civil government.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Arkansas
delegated the task of choosing a history of the United States
to the state superintendent of public instruction,<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> as well
as providing, in 1899, that there be included among the
textbooks of the schools, the history and civil government
of the state and nation.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> In Idaho, the county superintendent
selected the textbooks in “history,” and in California
the duty devolved upon the state board of education.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Among the branches of study in Texas and Alabama for
which law prescribed that there should be a uniform series
of books was United States history, and in Alabama was
added the history and constitution of the state.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The most common regulation regarding textbooks pertained
to the prohibition of books showing partisan, political
or sectarian bias.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In the South, particularly, were such
laws enacted. In February, 1890, a joint resolution “in
relation to histories to be taught in the public schools of
Mississippi” passed the legislature of that state. It urged
“the utmost care in the selection and introduction of school
histories,” in order to eliminate those considered “biased,
prejudiced and unfair,” or that suppressed a “full, free and
candid presentation of questions upon which the American
people” had been “honestly divided,” and in the maintenance
of which they had acted “according to the promptings
of courage and honor.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>Precisely the same motive actuated the lawmakers of
Alabama later in establishing county school boards to select
uniform series of textbooks for the public schools. These
boards were instructed to avoid “textbooks containing anything
partisan, prejudicial or inimical to the interests of the
people of the State” or which would “cast a reflection on
their past history.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Endorsement of history books favorable to the South was
the burden of a resolution of Georgia, in 1866, which commended
the Southern University series of school textbooks
under the auspices of the University of Virginia from the
pens of Captain M. F. Maury, Gilmore Simms, Honorable
Charles Gayarre, Judge B. F. Porter, Professors Le Compte,
Holmes, Venable, Schele, Devere, because they expressed a
“correct sentiment.”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This particularism became more
evident toward the close of the period as Southern legislatures
threw off the influence of carpet-bag domination.</p>

<p>Maryland’s legislation of 1868 and South Carolina’s of
1870 declared that “school books shall contain nothing of
a sectarian or partisan character.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Virginia as early as
1849 had subscribed to a similar statement,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and in 1872
both North Carolina and Georgia forbade the use of books
in the public schools which might partake of a “political”
or “sectional” bias.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>In Georgia, the county boards were not permitted “to
introduce into the schools any textbook or miscellaneous
book of a sectarian or sectional character.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> A South
Carolina law, pertaining to the general duties of the state
superintendent of education, accepted the phraseology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
common to many laws regarding textbooks in forbidding
“partisan” books or instruction.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Partisan textbooks were also excluded from the schools
of Alabama, Kansas, Arizona, Washington, and California.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
In Idaho and Montana legislation stipulated the rejection
of all books which would propagate “political” doctrines,
and in Texas it provided that nothing of a sectional or
partisan character should be included in the uniform series
of textbooks selected.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In Kentucky the county board of
examiners was given the task of selecting a uniform series
of textbooks for the county providing that the selection did
not include any books of “an immoral, sectional or sectarian
character.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The territory of Dakota legislating regarding
school libraries forbade not only books unsuited “to the
cultivation of good character and good morals and manners,”
but all “partisan political pamphlets and books.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>The evolution of laws respecting textbooks in this period
indicated the tendency toward a spirit of localism. The
South seized upon another opportunity in her legislation for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
textbooks to prohibit the teaching of a Northern viewpoint;
nine states of the Confederacy passed laws prohibiting the
use of “partisan” histories in their schools. The border
state of Kentucky also forbade “sectional” textbooks,
whereas the West attempted to exclude “partisan, political
books.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The laws passed by the North during the period
dealt largely with the naming of textbooks to be used in
the public schools.</p>

seminaries of learning were established upon the east and west sides of the
Suwanee River. The first purpose of these seminaries was to be the instruction
of persons in “all the various branches that pertain to a good common school education; and next to give instruction in the mechanic arts,
in husbandry and agricultural chemistry, in the fundamental laws, and in
what regards the rights and duties of citizens.” <i>Acts</i> of Florida, 1850-1861,

<p>The twentieth century did not usher in unexpected developments
in the American educational system, for the
school had begun to experience a transformation of purpose
in the period following the Civil War. It was not, however,
until after 1900 that the forces aroused by the Economic
Revolution began to assert themselves to a marked degree
and to seek means to equip the individual for the complex
responsibilities of his social relationships. The early years
of the new century saw a tidal wave of reform sweep into
all phases of American life. Agitation for the recall of
judicial decisions and the introduction of such measures as
the initiative and referendum attested new convictions in
the realm of politics. The reform spirit found expression
in muck-raking literature, movements for the betterment of
dependents on society, legislation to alleviate unfortunate
industrial conditions, and schemes of coöperation between
employer and employee bore testimony to a new social
consciousness and national morality.</p>

<p>The public school also gave evidence of the spirit of the
new era through the changed character of its instruction.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>
<p>“Preparation for citizenship” became the keynote of the
period, perhaps better expressed by John Dewey’s definition
of education as “The process of remaking experience, giving
it a more socialized value through increased individual experience
by giving the individual better control over his
powers.” History and the other social studies gained in
popularity as especially adapted to implant the right social
attitude.</p>

<p>This wider outlook on life did not confine itself solely to
an interest in domestic affairs, for the Spanish-American
War had banished the long-cherished theory of national
isolation. The international viewpoint was encouraged
further by the fact that by 1900 the United States had
achieved second place as an exporting nation. As a result,
the study of foreign history gained in popularity, and increased
offerings in the social studies curriculum evinced the
growing favor in which these subjects were held.</p>

<p>In planning the course of study, educational associations
showed much activity in committee reports. The report of
the Committee of Seven of the American Historical Association
doubtless had a pronounced influence in the curriculum
making of the greater part of this period. In 1907,
it was followed by the report of the Committee of Five,
who made slight changes in the list of studies recommended
by the Committee of Seven. However, modern European
history received greater emphasis than in the first report,
a tangible expression of the expanding horizon of the time.
In 1909, the Committee of Eight attempted to standardize
a course in history for the elementary schools, in which was
included not only United States history but a study of
European history.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>
<p>From 1900 to the year of our entrance into the World
War, thirty-two states approved laws incorporating history
and other social studies in the curriculum of the public
schools, approximately twice as many as had legislated
from 1860 to 1900.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The importance placed upon the study
of United States history, federal and local civics and state
history in the previous period persisted. The early years
of the century were characterized also by laws pertaining
to the teaching of patriotism through the celebration of
historic events, by statutes to inspire reverence for the flag,
and by enactments indicative of sectional interest.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>In 1900, Vermont amended her law prescribing the high
school course of study, and designated political economy,
civil government and general history among the branches
to be taught.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Other enactments, enumerating the prerequisites
for a high school, included thirty-three weeks of
history and the natural, political, social, moral and industrial
sciences.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In 1906, there was provided instruction for
elementary pupils in the history and constitution of the
United States and the history, constitution and principles
of the government of Vermont.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In 1915, the teaching of
“citizenship” was approved for all rural schools of a six
year course, and for elementary schools of eight years.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>The tendency to emphasize a study of the Constitution has
no better illustration than in the laws of New Hampshire,
where, in 1901, it was made compulsory for every high school
to give “reasonable instruction in the constitution of the
United States and in the constitution of New Hampshire.”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
Later enactments further stressed the importance of a
knowledge of the state and federal constitutions by prescribing
that “in all mixed schools and in all grades above
the primary, the constitution of the United States and of
the state of New Hampshire be read aloud by the scholars
at least once during the last year of the course below
the high school.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The teaching of citizenship was the
purpose of a Connecticut law of 1903 and of 1915,
prescribing regular instruction for all pupils above the
fourth grade in “the duties of citizenship, including the
knowledge of the form of national, state, and local government.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Training in citizenship was the purpose of a Delaware law
of 1911, which prescribed that teachers train their pupils in
“honesty, kindness, justice, and moral courage ... for the
purpose of lessening crime and raising the standard of good
citizenship.” Four years later it was followed by an enactment
requiring the teaching of United States history and
instruction in “the general principles of the constitution of
the United States” and of the state.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In 1911 Pennsylvania prescribed for the elementary
schools the teaching of United States history, history of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
state and civil government.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> These subjects received the
statutory endorsement of Kentucky in 1904, Virginia in
1904 and 1906, North Carolina in 1901, 1905, 1907, 1908
and 1913.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> South Carolina in several laws from 1892
required for schools under the direction of boards of trustees
and of county boards of education, the “history of the
United States and of this state, the principles of the constitution
of the United States and of this state, morals and
good behavior.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Texas gave her sanction to the same subjects in 1905,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and Alabama prescribed that in all schools and colleges
supported in whole or in part by public money, or under
state control, there should be instruction in the constitution
of the United States and of the state of Alabama.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In
Georgia, the law prescribed as part of the curriculum for
the common schools that “the elements of civil government
shall be included in the branches of study taught in the
common or public schools, and shall be studied and taught
as thoroughly and in the same manner as other like required
branches are studied and taught in said public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
West Virginia attained some individuality in adding to state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
and national history and civil government, “general and
West Virginia geography.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>In the schools of Florida instruction in “history” was
required for the intermediate grades, and in the grammar
grades the “history and civil government of Florida and
of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Additional emphasis was placed
upon the teaching of civics in 1909 when an act provided
that the “elements of civil government be taught in the
common and public schools of the state, ... to be studied
and taught as thoroughly and in the same manner as any
other required subjects.”<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Louisiana committed herself to the teaching of United
States history in every school district as an elementary
branch by an act of 1902;<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and Mississippi, in 1916, prescribed
for the “curriculum of the free public schools,”
civil government with special reference to local and state
government, the history of the nation and of the state.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>In 1904, Ohio established civil government and the history
of the United States as required subjects for an elementary
school education.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In 1910, it was made obligatory upon
each county board of school examiners to examine pupils
of township schools in civil government and United States
history.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In the <i>Code</i> of 1910, there were included, in both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
the elementary and high school courses of study, the history
of the United States and civil government, and in the high
school the history of “other countries” as well.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> By an
act approved May 18, 1911, but repealed in 1914, teachers
in elementary schools were required to qualify in the history
of the United States, including civil government, and in the
high school in general history, with an election of civil
government.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> An Illinois law of this period was similar
to that of Delaware in phraseology and spirit, and prescribed
the teaching of “honesty, kindness, justice and moral courage”
to lessen crime and develop a good citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>Wisconsin, as early as 1865, had required as essential for
a district school education, United States history and civil
government, local history and government, a practice continued
through 1917. In schools offering industrial education,
citizenship became an obligatory study by the statutes
of 1913.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Minnesota made a knowledge of United States
history prerequisite for entrance into high schools,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and
Indiana expanded her list of the required number of studies
to include, in all commissioned high schools, civil government,
general and state, ancient, medieval or modern history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and the history of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> For the curriculum
of the common schools, there was required in
Indiana the study of United States history, a practice
developed from a law first in force in August 1869.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>South Dakota,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> North Dakota,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and Kansas<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> also
committed themselves to the subjects popular in this period.
In Nebraska, “a study of American history for at least one
semester in the eleventh and twelfth grades,” became a
requirement for normal training courses in the high school.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Missouri made a knowledge of United States history essential
for entrance into the high schools, as well as prescribing
that no school could be classed as a high school which did
not include a four years’ course in history.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Oklahoma, in 1905, illustrated well the social viewpoint
characteristic of the time in her law requiring “in each and
every public school it should be the duty of each and every
teacher to teach morality in the broadest meaning of the
word, for the purpose of elevating and refining the character
of school children up to the highest plane of life; that they
may know how to conduct themselves as social beings in
relation to each other, as respects right and wrong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
rectitude of life, and thereby lessen wrong doing and
crime.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In 1907, another law prescribed “the elements
of economics” for all public schools receiving support from
the state.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>A place of prominence in the normal training curriculum
was accorded United States history by Oregon in 1911.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
In 1913, Wyoming enacted a law requiring of her superintendent
of public instruction the preparation of a course of
study for the elementary schools in the usual subjects, including
United States history and the history and civil
government of Wyoming,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> and by an act of 1917 history
and civics were required in the teacher training departments
of the high school.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> California, too, succumbed to the
trend of the times, and in 1903 and in succeeding years
prescribed the teaching of United States history and civil
government for a public school education.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>In the revision of her territorial laws in 1901, Arizona
again included United States history as a school subject;<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
and by legislation in 1912, New Mexico showed her approval
of the social studies in “An Act to Encourage the Instruction
in the History and Civics of the State of New Mexico.”
This law forbade any person to teach in the public schools
unless he had passed a satisfactory examination in the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
and civics of the United States as well as in the history
and civics of the state. “It shall be the duty of the teachers
in the public schools of the state,” the law read, “to give
such instruction as is practicable in the history and civics of
the United States with special reference to the history and
civics of the state of New Mexico; which said instruction
may be given orally or by study of textbooks covering the
subject and which said textbooks shall have been adopted
by the State Board of Education.” The statute specified
that the textbook in state history and civics must be prepared
“by a known historian of the state” and “be sold
at a price to be fixed by the State Board of Education not
to exceed one dollar per volume.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Of the thirty-two states which had enacted laws during
this period for the teaching of the social studies, substantially
all required United States history, federal and local
civics. State history, which had attained some popularity
in the preceding period, received attention in many statutes.
Laws requiring the teaching of European history in some
form were found in Vermont, Indiana, Ohio and Missouri,
and economics was prescribed in the laws of Oklahoma and
Vermont.</p>


<h4>CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS</h4>

<p>The tendency to enlarge and enrich the social studies
curriculum was more evident in the requirements for
teachers’ certificates than in the courses of study prescribed
by law. These requirements, in general, included ancient,
medieval and modern history, general history, English history,
economics and sociology, besides civil government,
state history and history of the United States. Especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
was there an increased offering of subjects for high school
teachers. In the elementary and county licenses only civics
and United States history were required with the greatest
frequency. Among those states which passed new laws
or reënacted old legislation offering ancient, medieval or
modern history were California, Idaho, Oregon, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, and Texas.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> English history
appeared among the subjects in the laws of Idaho, Nevada,
Kansas, and Wisconsin;<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> general history was one of the
requirements for certification in the laws of West Virginia,
Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Illinois, Minnesota,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Nebraska, South Dakota, Utah, Nevada, Washington, and
Idaho.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>Economics, or, as it was more commonly known, political
economy, was prescribed in Iowa, Nebraska, and
Wyoming.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> South Dakota permitted for examination either
sociology or economics,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and Wisconsin and Arkansas insisted
upon a knowledge of “rural economics.”<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> “Current
events” or “current history” were among the requirements
of South Dakota in her law of 1919, and of Nevada, in 1907,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and in 1921, for certification of primary, grammar and
high school classes.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>State history and the study of the state constitution received
recognition in the requirements of Pennsylvania,
Delaware, West Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama,
Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Illinois,
Kansas, and New Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Of all of the social studies required for certification,
however, United States history and civil government were
the most popular, being prescribed in some law in every
state excepting Arizona.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In some of the states where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
was no special enactment prescribing United States history
or civics, the examining board may have been given the
privilege of naming the subjects for examining the candidates,
or, through custom, they may have become a part of
the subjects in which examinations were held. It is also
true that colleges and normal schools have taken over the
preparation of teachers in the subjects which they are to
teach, making unnecessary many of the examinations previously
held.</p>


<h4>FLAG LEGISLATION AND OBSERVANCE DAYS</h4>

<p>A means of implanting patriotism in the pupils of the
public schools has been legislation pertaining to the display
of the American flag, the development of a proper attitude
toward it, and the singing of the national anthem. Ten
states gave expression to this form of training for patriotism
in this period. Similar to such enactments was the legal
provision made for the observance of the birthdays of great
men and the commemoration of historic events by classroom
exercises. In addition, there was a constantly growing
number of legal holidays upon which no school was in
session.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>Laws respecting the flag were, and are, of three general
kinds: (1) that each school must possess a flag for display
in a conspicuous place, (2) that proper respect for the flag
be taught, and (3) that suitable exercises be engaged in at
definitely stated intervals. This last type of law often
proves the occasion for the reciting in unison of the salute
to the flag, the so-called “American Creed,” or the preamble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
to the Constitution. In the second variety of law a pledge
of allegiance is the keynote of the sentiment expressed, such
as: “I pledge allegiance to my flag and to the Republic for
which it stands; one nation indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all”; or, “We give our hearts and our hands
to God and our Country; one country, one flag, and one
language.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>In 1898, New York enacted “flag” legislation which had
the three-fold characteristics of such laws. Within the next
few years this law was followed by statutes of like kind in
Massachusetts, Indiana, Iowa, and Arizona. However, as
later legislation appeared, it took on a more elaborate
phraseology, with a more open avowal of patriotic purpose.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
This is well illustrated by an act of 1909 in Indiana, which
ordered that “the state board of education shall require
the singing of the ‘Star Spangled Banner’ in its entirety
in the schools of the state of Indiana, upon all patriotic
occasions,” with the necessary admonition “that the
said board of education shall arrange to supply the
words in sufficient quantity for the purposes indicated
therein.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>“An Act to provide for the display of the United States
flag on the school houses of the state, in connection with the
public schools, and to encourage patriotic exercises in such
schools,” became a law in Kansas, March 7, 1907. By
this act the state superintendent was instructed to prepare
a program for the salute to the flag at the opening of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
day of school, as well as “such other patriotic exercises as
may be deemed by him to be expedient.”<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Relying upon the governor’s proclamation, New Jersey,
in 1915, set aside the week of September sixth to thirteenth
for appropriate exercises to be held, at least one day in the
interval named, by schools and churches in commemoration
of the one hundredth birthday of the national anthem.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>In her <i>Revised Statutes</i> which took effect on January 1,
1917, Maine incorporated a flag law evolved from enactments
of 1907 and 1915, whereby superintendents of schools
were directed to display the flag from public school buildings
on suitable occasions. Towns were directed to appropriate
annually “a sufficient amount to defray the necessary cost
of the display of the flag,” and it was made “the duty of
instructors to impress upon the youth by suitable references
and observances the significance of the flag, to teach them
the cost, the object and principles of our government, the
great sacrifices of our forefathers, the important part taken
by the Union army in the war of eighteen hundred sixty-one
to eighteen hundred sixty-five, to teach them to love, honor
and respect the flag of our country that cost so much and
is so dear to every true American citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Closely akin to the enactments respecting the flag and
patriotic exercises were those designating days for special
patriotic observance.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Laws providing for the establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of Memorial Day are of such a character. In general,
Memorial Day legislation was sectional in character and
acclaimed the results of the Civil War from the Northerner’s
standpoint. In 1886, the Kansas legislature, moved by
patriotic feeling, had resolved to observe the day in fitting
manner, inasmuch as “during the past ten or twelve years
the loyal people of the United States, inspired by a sentiment
of reverent respect for the memory of our heroic dead, have
by spontaneous consent, dedicated the thirtieth day of May
of each year to ceremonies in honor of the soldiers who
cheerfully sacrificed their own lives to save the life of the
republic. ‘They need no praise whose deeds are eulogy,’
and nothing that we can now say or do will add to the glory
or brighten the fame of the gallant host who, a quarter of a
century ago, came thronging from farms, workshops, offices
and schools, to fight, to suffer and die for the Union and
freedom. But the story of their sublime self-sacrifice, and
their dauntless courage, should be kept forever fresh
and fair in the hearts and minds of the young, until the end
of recorded time. So long as men and women teach their
children to revere the memory of patriot heroes, so long as
the peaceful present honors and emulates the example of
the war-worn past, there need be no fear that the dead have
died in vain, or that ‘a government of the people, by the
people, for the people,’ will perish from the earth. The
steadily growing popularity of Memorial Day, and the universal
interest taken in its beautiful ceremonies, is one of
the most hopeful developments of American sentiments.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Conceding the importance of a proper recognition of
Memorial Day, Vermont in 1894 appointed the last half
day’s session before May the thirtieth for exercises “commemorative
of the history of the nation during the war of
the Rebellion, and to patriotic instruction in the principles
of liberty and the equal rights of man.” The popularity of
this law is attested by its continuance on the Vermont
statute books in her <i>Compilation</i> of 1917.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>In 1890, Massachusetts, and in 1897, New Hampshire
established in these commonwealths the custom of observing
May the thirtieth by exercises of a patriotic nature in
the schools.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> New York, in 1898, Arizona in 1903, and
Kansas in 1907, also subscribed to the sentiment which
dictated that Memorial Day be given special recognition.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The birthdays of Lincoln and Washington were also given
recognition by New York in 1898, Arizona in 1903, and
Kansas in 19O7.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The year 1909 witnessed an expression
of patriotic enthusiasm over Lincoln’s contribution to the
American nation, awakened, no doubt, by the centenary of
his birth. During this year California, Maine, and New
Mexico prescribed special observance of February the
twelfth. Rhode Island followed in 1910, West Virginia in
1911, with Vermont in 1912 and in 1917.</p>

<p>“February 12, the birthday of Abraham Lincoln is hereby
declared a legal holiday,” stated the law of California,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
which is typical of others of this group, “<i>provided, however</i>,
that all public schools throughout the state shall hold sessions
in the forenoon of that day in order to allow the
customary exercises in memory of Lincoln; and <i>provided
further</i>, that when February 12 falls on Sunday, then the
Monday following, shall be a legal holiday and shall be so
observed; and <i>provided still further</i>, that when February 12
falls on Saturday such exercises in the public schools shall
take place on the Friday afternoon preceding.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In Rhode
Island, the day was called “Grand Army Flag Day,” and
was, in 1914, still one of those days upon which special
exercises were held.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Michigan prescribed the reading of the Declaration of
Independence to all pupils in the public schools above the
fifth grade upon the twelfth and twenty-second of February,
and upon the twelfth of October, with an obviously patriotic
intent, in her legislation of 1911.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Washington’s
birthday occasioned legislation in Maryland in 1904 and
in Maine in 1913, as a day suitable for the propagation of
patriotism.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>In the latter state Columbus Day, October 12, was included
in those observance days upon which exercises should
“aim to impress on the minds of the youth the important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
lessons of character and good citizenship to be learned from
the lives of American leaders and heroes and from a
contemplation of their own duties and obligations to the
community, state, and nation of which they constituted a
part.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Columbus Day received the recognition of several
other state legislatures, Michigan, West Virginia, Louisiana,
and Oregon especially setting it aside for patriotic purposes.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>Flag Day, likewise, was deemed worthy of observance.
New York in her legislation of 1898, Arizona in 1903, and
Kansas in 1907 included it among those days set aside for
special exercises in the schools.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Connecticut decreed, in
1905, that the governor, annually in the spring, should
designate by official proclamation the fourteenth day of
June as Flag Day, upon which “suitable exercises, having
reference to the adoption of the national flag be held in the
public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>In 1906, a proclamation of the governor of New Jersey,
couched in grandiloquent phraseology, recommended that
suitable exercises be held in the public schools for commemorating
the birthday of the American flag. It urged
a more extended knowledge of the flag’s history. “The
history of our flag is the history of the growth of our nation,”
he proclaimed, “and the celebration of the anniversary of
its birth is not only a patriotic duty but an educational
privilege. On the day of its inception it stood as an emblem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of the unity of a few modest little colonies. To-day it is
the symbol of a mighty nation. It has floated over many a
battlefield, inspiring the sons of patriotism with a courage
and strength that made possible the triumph of the right
and the preservation of the Union. It has been carried to
far distant lands and has aroused the enthusiasm of thousands
to whom its advent meant emancipation from cruelty
and oppression.”<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Reminiscent of the local history movement of the decades
following the Civil War was legislation prescribing the celebration
of days of interest peculiar to different states. In
1897, Massachusetts passed a resolution recommending to
the governor that he issue a proclamation to public school
teachers suggesting commemorative exercises for the centennial
of the inauguration of “John Adams of Massachusetts,”
in order “to impress upon their pupils the significance
of the inauguration of the president of the United States
and the importance of the part sustained by the commonwealth
in American history.”<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>“Rhode Island Independence Day” was acclaimed in
1909, for May the fourth. At this time, so the statute read,
the celebration of the “first official act of its kind by any
of the thirteen American colonies” in a declaration of
sovereignty and independence took place. From the date of
the passage of the law, every fourth of May in the future,
it was determined, should become the occasion for the salute
of thirteen guns by detachments of the state artillery, at all
places in the state where artillery was stationed, besides a
display of state and national flags, as well as patriotic
exercises in the public schools.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>March the eighteenth assumed a distinctive place in the
school calendar of South Carolina by a law enacted in 1906,
being known as “South Carolina Day.” The selection of
this date sprang from a desire to honor John C. Calhoun,
and from the hope that an observance of this day would
“conduce to a more general knowledge and appreciation
of the history, resources and possibilities of the State.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
In like spirit Georgia, in 1909, endeavored to awaken local
pride in the pupils of the public schools by a celebration
of “Georgia Day” on February twelfth, “as the landing
of the first colonists in Georgia under Oglethorpe.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Confederate
heroes received special tribute by patriotic exercises
on January nineteenth, the birthday of Robert E. Lee,
through a law of Arkansas. The program of exercises, the
law prescribed, should deal with events connected with the
life of General Lee and “other distinguished Southern men”
with attention to those men of renown in civil and military
life.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In Maryland, the state board of education, by a
law of 1904, was given the privilege of naming a time
suitable for the observance of “Maryland Day.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>“The geography, history, industries and resources” of
Minnesota, through a law of 1911, received especial attention
in the public schools on “Minnesota Day.”<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Montana,
through a celebration of “Pioneer Day” endeavored
to instruct in the pioneer history of the region.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Missouri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
paid homage to her state history in a law of 1915 through
observance by teachers and pupils on the first Monday in
October. At this time, the law prescribed the “methodical
consideration of the products of the mine, field and forest
of the state” and the “consideration of the achievements
of the sons and daughters of Missouri in commerce, literature,
statesmanship and art, and in other departments of
activity in which the state has rendered service to mankind.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The American Indians, through a law of 1919,
in Illinois, were likewise deemed worthy of commemorative
exercises.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The persisting desire of the lawmaker to instil patriotism,
either local or national, in pupils in the public schools has
been the incentive for laws respecting the flag and observance
days. Local pride is evident in the Northern laws for
the observance of Memorial Day and the birthday of Lincoln;
whereas in the South a sectional interest is shown in
days memorializing the heroes of their section. The Middle
and Far West have also attempted to inculcate local pride.
There is a dearth of legislation in the Southern states for
the commemoration of Flag Day by special exercises, but
Washington and Columbus have been accorded homage by
both the North and the South.</p>


<h4>TEXTBOOK LEGISLATION</h4>

<p>Textbook legislation from 1900 to 1917 followed the trend
of other legislation of the time. As the curriculum of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
social studies expanded, laws dealing with textbooks were
made to include more subjects for which there was to be a
uniform series selected. State history and civil government,
both local and national, as well as foreign history and other
social studies, were found more frequently among the subjects
enumerated. The reaction which had set in against
the enforced nationalism of the Reconstruction period in the
South continued to express itself in those states in which
there had hitherto been no open remonstrance.</p>

<p>In 1904, the Mississippi legislature instructed the textbook
commission to select a uniform series of textbooks in
United States history, civil government, state history and
other subjects, and took occasion to prescribe that “no
history in relation to the late civil war between the states
shall be used in the schools in this state unless it be fair
and impartial,....”<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Presumably of like character was the action of North
Carolina in 1905. In “An Act to Promote the Production
and Publication of School Books relating to the History,
Literature or Government of North Carolina for use in the
Public Schools,” there was appropriated $5,000 for the
years of 1905 and 1906 for the state board of education “to
encourage, stimulate and promote the production and to
procure the control and publication of such books as in the
judgment of the board properly relate to the history, literature
and government of North Carolina.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Florida’s sectionalism was openly avowed in her “Act
for Providing a Method of Securing a Correct History of the
United States, Including a True and Correct History of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
the Confederacy, and Making an Appropriation for such
Purpose.” The act declared: “Whereas, no book called
History, which does not tell the truth or withholds it, is
worthy of the name or should be taught in public schools;
and,</p>

<p>“Whereas, the South is rich in historical facts that are
either ignored or never mentioned in the so-called histories
taught in our schools; and,</p>

<p>“Whereas, the Southern States have been derelict in their
duty to posterity in not having provided for past and future
generations a history that is fair, just and impartial to all
sections”; therefore it was enacted that Florida appropriate
$1500 as her share toward a fund of $16,500 to be offered
as a prize to the person writing the “best history of the
United States in which the truth about the participation of
the eleven states” be told.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>In the creation of a textbook board in 1907, Texas regarded
it essential that a uniform series of books be selected
among which there should be textbooks on the history of
Texas, civil government and United States history, in which
“the construction placed on the federal constitution by the
Fathers of the Confederacy shall be fairly presented.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>A uniform series of textbooks not of a partisan character
were prescribed by laws in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Kansas, and included the subjects of United States
history, state history, and civil government.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Louisiana,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Indiana, and Kansas added ancient, medieval and modern
history textbooks to others previously prescribed.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> In 1901
Nevada included the history of the United States among
the textbooks to be prescribed by the state board of education,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
and Idaho, in 1907, imposed the choice of a civil
government textbook and one in United States history upon
her State Board of Textbook Commissioners and the superintendent
of public instruction.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> In 1913, California directed
her state board of education to revise the state series
of textbooks which included United States history.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Three states, Ohio, New Mexico, and West Virginia placed
laws upon their statute books regarding state history, Ohio
accepting Howe’s <i>Historical Collections of Ohio</i> as a reference
book,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> and New Mexico limiting to one dollar a volume
the price of a state history which was to be prepared by a
“known historian of the state.”<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> Davies’ <i>Facts in Civil</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
<i>Government</i>, by an act of 1901 of West Virginia was again
endorsed and the price fixed at 55 cents.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Four states, during the period, in addition to three
commonwealths which named “partisan” textbooks, enacted
laws to exclude histories held to be sectional in spirit.
Legislation in all other cases dealt with provisions for a
uniform series of textbooks. The statutes of Louisiana,
Indiana, and Kansas showed the expansion of the social
study curriculum in providing for textbooks in ancient,
medieval and modern history. Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi
and Kansas regulated the purchase of textbooks in
state and national history and in civics. In California, Ohio,
New Mexico and West Virginia provisions were made relative
to state history textbooks, and Idaho and Nevada in
their laws recognized a need for textbooks in civil government
or United States history.</p>

liberalized. According to Cubberley, “The modern school aims to train
pupils for greater social usefulness and to give them a more intelligent grasp

<h4>THE CURRICULUM</h4>

<p>When the Fathers of New England adopted the famous
laws of 1642 and 1647, they acted on the belief that by
the school the character of the nation can be moulded.
Throughout nearly three centuries of development the confidence
of the American people in the regenerating power
of the public school has grown. They have come to hold
high faith in education as an effective tool for the conservation
and promotion of national well-being. In each epoch,
the school has attempted to accommodate its offerings to
the demands of the time, thereby reflecting the needs of a
people whose point of view is constantly changing. First
conceived as a force in the religious life of the people, the
school soon became an instrument for the development of
“morality, virtue and good behavior.” The latter eighteenth
century captured the vision of a people fired with
patriotism and service to the state, and then by a citizenry
trained to “preserve and perfect a republican constitution.”
The occasion of a diverse and scattered electorate caused by
the democratic awakening of the Jacksonian era compelled
acceptance of the theory that it was a duty of the state to
provide education for all. After the Civil War, a renewed
faith in nationality and a realization of the economic and
social demands of the time left their imprint upon the public
school curriculum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>The opening of the twentieth century witnessed the expansion
of the “citizenship aim” to include training for
efficient participation in a complex social and industrial life.
Since then, many traditional subjects of the previous period
have been superseded by those tending to give point to the
new aims in education; and of the traditional subjects
retained many have been refashioned to fit a new and
present-day point of view.</p>

<p>This wider horizon has tended to encourage to a greater
degree than hitherto the introduction of many social studies,
including economics, sociology and foreign history. Although
encumbered with survivals, the history curriculum
of the twentieth century has sought independence of purely
political and military events and has striven for a scientific
presentation of historical truths which should fit for “complete
living.” This new viewpoint was well exemplified in
the report of a committee of the National Education Association
in 1916, which proposed a six year course in the
social studies from the seventh to the twelfth grades, stressing
the teaching of practical and present-day problems.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the United States entered the World
War. America at once faced not only the necessity of
mobilizing the economic and military resources of a country
unprepared for war, but also that still more difficult problem—the
consolidation of public opinion. Various agencies
were created for the express purpose of coördinating the
spiritual resources of the country. Such was the design of
the Committee on Public Information. Speakers and writers
gave freely of their talents, and “hyphenism” and pacifism
were driven to cover. The Espionage Law betrayed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
apprehension of the federal government regarding unbridled
speech and writing, and sedition laws in different commonwealths
served to arrest an open opposition to the War.</p>

<p>Following the War the fear of radicalism and disloyalty
to the established institutions of the country continued to
express itself in drastic legislation. In the public schools,
the desire to develop an unalloyed patriotism proved the
motive for the passage of statutes to promote a dynamic
loyalty. In general, these laws relate to the teaching of
patriotism through instruction in the history and government
of the United States, open affirmations of loyalty by
the teaching personnel, the exclusion of alien teachers from
the public schools, flag legislation and observance days,
enactments regarding textbooks, and the Americanization of
foreigners. Practically all legislation since 1917 dealing
with the curriculum contains provisions pertaining to the
social studies, and the greater amount reflects the wartime
glow of patriotic enthusiasm.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>In 1917 three states passed regulatory provisions respecting
the curriculum. Vermont’s legislation dealt with four-year
high schools and required the teaching of the political
and social sciences.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> On February 17, Montana approved
a law which called for instruction in United States history,
the history of Montana, and state and federal civics among
other required subjects for the elementary school, and three
days later Arkansas approved a similar law.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> New Hampshire,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Texas continued
laws enacted at a previous time,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> and Delaware,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
through legislation in 1919 gained the unique distinction of
prescribing “community civics” besides the history of the
nation and of the state.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Alabama and Georgia under laws
designed primarily to prescribe a uniform series of textbooks
included in the list of studies for which textbooks were
mentioned, the history of the state embracing the constitution
of the state, and the history of the United States with
the constitution.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In Tennessee, to the requirement of
United States history for the elementary schools, was added
in 1917 the study of the federal constitution in the secondary
school curriculum.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Texas placed distinct emphasis upon
the teaching of state history through a regulation insisting
that this “history be taught in the history course in all
public schools” and “in this course only.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The popularity
of civil government, state history, and United States history
is further proved by South Dakota’s prescription in 1919.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>Laws for dynamic patriotism were initiated by a statute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
of California in 1917. One of the mildest of the laws of
this type, its chief purpose was training in the duties of
citizenship through the study of United States history, with
special reference to the history of the Constitution and the
reasons for the adoption of each constitutional provision.
Instruction in local civil government was provided for as
well, with a specific statement regarding instruction in the
duties of citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>In 1918, South Dakota, Texas and New York placed upon
their statute books laws that were likewise a direct outgrowth
of the war spirit. In the first two states, patriotism,
the laws declared, should spring from lessons of “intelligent
patriotism” inculcated by special exercises. The South
Dakota law specified an hour a week in the aggregate, to
be devoted in both public and private institutions “to the
teaching of patriotism, the singing of patriotic songs, the
reading of patriotic addresses and a study of the lives and
history of American patriots.” Should an instructor, school
officer or superintendent fail to enforce obedience to the law
the statute provided for a fine of not less than five dollars
nor more than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the
county jail from five to thirty days, or both. In the case
of the malfeasance of a teacher, the superintendent of public
instruction had the power to revoke his certificate.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>In Texas, the law declared that “the daily program of
every public school should be so formulated that it includes
at least ten minutes for the teaching of lessons of intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
patriotism, including the needs of the State and Federal
Governments, the duty of the citizens to the State, and the
obligation of the State to the citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The statute concluded
with this statement: “The fact that this nation is
now at war with a foreign foe, and that the strength of a
government of the people, by the people, and for the people
must necessarily come of its citizenship, creates an emergency
and an imperative public necessity that the constitutional
rule requiring bills to be read on three several days
be suspended and that this act shall be in force from and
after its passage, and it is so enacted.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>New York’s statute, known as the Lusk Law, is the most
conspicuous of all of the laws of this period because of its
drastic character and its later applications. This law became
effective September 1, 1918. The phase of the law
relating to instruction had two parts: one prescribing courses
of instruction in patriotism and citizenship, the other specifying
rules for inspection, supervision, and enforcement of
the law.</p>

<p>“In order to promote a spirit of patriotic and civic service
and obligation and to foster in the children of the state
moral and intellectual qualities which are essential in preparing
to meet the obligations of citizenship in peace or in
war,” the law declared, “the regents of the university of
the state of New York shall prescribe courses of instruction
in patriotism and citizenship to be maintained and followed
in the schools of the state. The boards of education and
trustees of the several cities and school districts of the state
shall require instruction to be given in such courses, by
the teachers employed in the schools therein. All pupils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
attending such schools, over the age of eight years, shall
attend upon such instruction.”</p>

<p>The statute further prescribed similar courses of instruction
for private schools, and was required of all pupils over
eight years of age. In case such courses were not maintained
in the private school, attendance upon instruction in
such school was not deemed equivalent to instruction given
to pupils of like age in the public schools.</p>

<p>The law empowered the regents of the University of the
State of New York to determine the subjects to be included
in courses in patriotism and citizenship, and to arrange such
other matters as were required for carrying into effect the
objects and purposes of the law. The commissioner of
education was made responsible for its enforcement, and
to him fell the supervision and inspection of instruction.
He was given authority at his discretion to withhold, from
a school district or city, school money, if the authorities
neglected such courses or failed to compel attendance upon
such instruction.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>In 1918, Massachusetts subscribed to training in the
duties of citizenship, including United States history, civil
government, and thrift in her public schools; and two years
later, in a statute relating to all elementary and secondary
schools, she prescribed “courses in American history and
civics for the purpose of promoting civic service and a
greater knowledge of American history and of fitting the
pupils, morally and intellectually, for the duties of citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>In 1919, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas
and Washington passed laws of like character. Although
each embodies certain distinctive features, yet all assert a
belief in the study of American history and government as
a preparation for a patriotic citizenship.</p>

<p>The New Jersey law contains concrete requirements. In
each high school, courses of study in “Community Civics”
and in “Problems in American Democracy” were prescribed
through the agency of the Commissioner of Education,
with the approval of the State Board of Education.
The law required that “Community Civics” be completed
not later than the end of the second year, and the course
in “Problems of American Democracy” be commenced
not later than the beginning of the third year. Sixty full
periods of not less than forty minutes each were specified
for the teaching of these subjects. For the elementary
grades, the geography, history and civics of New Jersey
were prescribed. These courses of study, the law provided,
“shall be given together with instruction as to the privileges
and responsibilities of citizenship as they relate to community
and national welfare with the object of producing
the highest type of patriotic citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, too, it has become a duty of the state
superintendent of public instruction to prescribe “a course
of study conducive to the spirit of loyalty and devotion to
the state and national governments,” and for all elementary
public schools instruction in the history of the state and
nation, including the elements of civil government.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
the seventh and eighth grades Ohio prescribed civil government
and United States history; and Iowa, as a prerequisite
to graduation from any high school, required a course in
United States history and civil government for one year, as
well as the offering of a semester of social problems and
economics in a four-year high school. In Kansas, where
the course in civil government and United States history
was designed for the elementary grades, provision was made,
in the case of noncompliance with the law, for the closing
of the school by the action of the county attorney or the
attorney-general. It was in a like spirit with other commonwealths
that Washington declared the “study of American
history and American government” to be “indispensable
to good citizenship and an accurate appreciation of national
ideals.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> A similar provision, with the aim of promoting
“Americanism” and in training in the “ideals and principles
underlying the government of the United States,”
met defeat in Maryland in 1920 by the veto of the
governor.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>

<p>The year 1921 was particularly prolific in legislation of
a wartime character. A variety of expression but a unity
of purpose continued to be in evidence. Laws were enacted
in Maine, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah, Arizona,
Nevada, New Mexico, and California.</p>

<p>The Maine statute prescribed the teaching of American
history and civil government in all elementary and high
school grades, both private and public, and made these
subjects a requirement for graduation from all grammar
schools.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The law of her neighbor, New Hampshire, required
the reading of the constitution of the United States
and of New Hampshire “at least once a year in the last
grade below the high school.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In line with the other states Michigan declared, by a
statute of May 17, 1921, that the study of the state and
federal constitutions should begin not later than the eighth
grade and continue throughout the high school course to an
extent to be decided upon by the state superintendent of
public instruction.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> In Wisconsin, provision was made for
instruction in the history and civil government of the United
States and of Wisconsin, and in citizenship,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and Illinois,
on June 21, 1921, passed “An Act to make the teaching of
representative government in the public schools and other
educational institutions in the State of Illinois compulsory.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
This law endorsed the teaching of patriotism
through a knowledge of “the principles of representative
government, as enumerated in the Declaration of Independence
and the Constitution of the United States and the
Constitution of the State of Illinois,” and was required in
all schools maintained in whole or in part by state funds.
The law provided, also, for one hour of such instruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
each week in the seventh and eighth grades, with an equal
amount of time in the high school.</p>

<p>On March 31, 1921, Iowa added to her requirements a
provision that all public and private schools should give
regular courses of instruction in the constitution of the state
and nation, beginning not later than the eighth grade and
continuing in the high school to an extent to be determined
by the superintendent of public instruction. A Nebraska
statute of that year established for all schools courses in
American history and civil government to give “a thorough
knowledge of the history of our country and its institutions
and of our form of government.”<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>In Oklahoma, instruction in American history must commence
in the primary grades of all schools, both public and
private, beginning with the lowest and continuing through
all primary years, with the privilege of substituting state
history in one of the grades. For this instruction, there
should be allotted at least one hour each week. It was
specifically stated that the purpose of the statute was to
instil in the hearts of the pupils “an understanding of the
United States and of a love of country and devotion to the
principles of American government,” and that “such instruction
... shall avoid, as far as possible, being a mere
recital of dates and events.” For the high school, at least
one full year’s work in American history and civics was
required, and no college, normal school, university or chartered
institution of learning in the state was allowed to confer
a degree until a student had passed a course in American
history and civil government.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The social study requirement of Colorado for her public
schools consisted of the history and civil government of the
state,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and Arizona in her law specified that not less than
two years’ instruction in civics, economics, and American
political history and government be provided for all common
schools, high schools, normal schools and universities.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
Nevada, in her enactment of February 24, compelled all
schools including colleges, save exclusively scientific schools,
to teach American history, history of the state, and American
civil government.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Included as a part of this law was
a provision for patriotic exercises for at least an hour in
each school week. New Mexico, declaring that the passage
of a law prescribing the teaching of national and state history
and government was “necessary for the public peace and
safety,” made the statute effective immediately,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and California
again essayed an endorsement of the history of the
state and nation with emphasis upon the adoption of the
Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>In 1922 the commonwealth of Virginia enacted a law
similar to those passed the previous year in fourteen other
states. By this statute, pupils enrolled in the public free
schools are taught civil government, history of the United
States and the history of Virginia. The 1922 session of the
Rhode Island legislature adopted much the same kind of a
provision for all public and private schools by making obligatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
the teaching of the principles of popular and representative
government and the history of Rhode Island.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>An adherence to the early method of endorsing the teaching
of patriotism characterized enactments in Idaho, Nevada,
and Utah. In the last state, instruction “tending to impress
upon the minds of the pupils the importance and
necessity of good manners, truthfulness, temperance, purity,
patriotism, and industry,” was prescribed in connection with
the regular school work.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Nevada, four years before the
passage of Utah’s law, provided for civic training in her high
schools, whose purpose was to “inculcate a love of country
and a disposition to serve the country effectively and
loyally,” both in times of peace and of war.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Idaho, through the office of the teacher, continued the
practice of prescribing the teaching of patriotism as a duty
of the teacher through that intangible method of impressing
upon the minds of the pupils “the principles of truth,
justice, morality, and patriotism.”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Wisconsin, also, sanctioned
moral instruction through training by the teacher.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Since 1923, nineteen states have passed laws affecting the
social study curriculum. In general, their purpose is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
instil “into the hearts of the various pupils ... an understanding
of the United States, ... a love of country, and
... a devotion to the principles of the American Government.”<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Through statutes passed in 1923, Arkansas, Mississippi,
Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia require the teaching of
United States history and the Constitution; and Kansas
adopted the same requirement in 1925.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Instruction in the
federal constitution is prescribed in Alabama, Idaho, New
Jersey, Oregon and Utah by enactments in 1923, and in
New York by a law of 1924. Statutes in Delaware and
North Carolina<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> require the study of the constitutions of
the nation and the state, and Texas adds to that regulation
a recommendation that special emphasis be placed on “the
guarantees contained in the Bill of Rights.”<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The Minnesota
law prescribes for all schools “regular courses in the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
United States, to an extent to be determined by the State
Commissioner of Education.”<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In New Mexico a similar
enactment requires an understanding of the Declaration of
Independence, as well as a knowledge of state and national
history and government.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>For her schools California establishes “regular courses of
instruction in the constitution of the United States, including
the study of American institutions and ideals,” and
Georgia adopts a similar requirement adding the study of
state government. In both states it is provided that no
pupil shall receive a certificate of graduation who has not
passed satisfactorily examinations in the required subjects.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Substantially all these enactments provide that instruction
in the required subjects shall begin in the elementary grades,
continue in the high school and in courses in state colleges,
universities and educational departments of state and municipal
institutions to an extent to be determined by the
superintendent of public instruction or by the state board of
education.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>Endorsement of the study of the Constitution was given
by Congress in March, 1925, when the Senate passed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
House resolution expressing “the earnest hope and desire
that every educational institution, whether public or private,
will provide and maintain as a part of the required curriculum,
a course for the study of the Constitution of the
United States....”</p>

<p>The many laws enacted during the years following the
World War are indicative of the high value placed upon the
social studies as an essential part of education. Besides
laws requiring the teaching of these subjects purely for their
content, many enactments express a high faith that the social
studies will serve to inculcate patriotism and to train for
citizenship. Forty-three commonwealths have engaged in
legislation of this character since 1917, and all states have
at some time endorsed history as a required subject in the
public schools.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>


<h4>OATHS OF ALLEGIANCE AND CITIZENSHIP FOR TEACHERS</h4>

<p>Few laws requiring American citizenship and oaths of
allegiance, in the case of teachers, appeared on the statute
books prior to 1914. The World War precipitated the
movement for enactments which insist upon an openly
avowed loyalty, as well as upon a teaching personnel consisting
of citizens only.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>In 1915, three states enacted anti-alien laws for teaching.
A Michigan statute required a teacher, if twenty-one years
of age, to be a citizen of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Nevada directed
the superintendent of public instruction, the regents
of the state university and school trustees to dismiss “any
teacher, ..., professor or president employed by the educational
department of this state who is not a citizen of the
United States; or who has not declared his or her intention
to become a citizen.” The law forbade any state controller
or county auditor to issue salary warrants to the persons
mentioned, in case of non-citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>In California a law of 1915 prescribed that “no person
except a native-born or naturalized citizen of the United
States, should be employed in any department of the state,
county, city and county or city-government of this state.”
An exception, however, was made in favor of teachers who
had declared their intention to become naturalized and of
any native-born wife of a foreigner.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>In 1917, the one hundred and fortieth session of the New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
York legislature gave its assent to a bill which has become
known as one of the Lusk laws. This law reflects precisely
the same sort of apprehension which moved some of the
legislators of the Civil War period. It became the precursor
of three others of a like nature, one in 1918, one in 1919,
and one in 1921. The law of 1917 related to treasonable
or seditious utterances by teachers, the second and third to
the granting of teachers’ licenses to citizens only, and the
fourth to the employment of teachers who have criticized the
government of the United States.</p>

<p>The law of 1917 relating to freedom of speech prescribed
that “a person employed as superintendent of schools,
teacher or employee in the public schools, ... shall be removed
from such position for the utterance of any treasonable
or seditious act, or acts, while holding such position.”<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
The laws of 1918 and 1919 made citizenship an essential
qualification for becoming a teacher. Any person employed
as a teacher on April 4, 1918, however, who was not naturalized,
was given permission to remain in his position provided
he, within a year, should make application for citizenship.
The law of 1919 exempted from the foregoing requirement
teachers who were citizens of the Allied Powers in the World
War, and who had been employed as teachers in the New
York schools on or prior to April 4, 1918, provided that
“such teacher make application to become a citizen before
the first day of September, 1920, and within the time thereafter
prescribed by law shall become such citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>The third link in the chain of constraint was an enactment
which declared that an applicant, even though a citizen,
must be “a person of good moral character” and must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
be “loyal and obedient to the government of this state and
of the United States,” in order to obtain a license to teach.
For “no such certificate shall be issued to any person who,
while a citizen of the United States, has advocated either
by word of mouth or in writing, a change in the form of
government of the United States or of this state, by force,
violence or any unlawful means.” The statute provided
that the discovery that a teacher were guilty of any of the
prohibitions mentioned, made him liable to a revocation of
his certificate through the commissioner of education.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The
sum of $15,000 was appropriated to carry the act into
effect.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Much discussion and agitation attended the Lusk laws
after their passage and in the attempts at their enforcement,
for many believed that the right of free speech was endangered
by such measures. In 1923, under considerable pressure,
the legislature revoked the statute, and Governor
Alfred E. Smith affixed his signature to the repeal.</p>

<p>Laws similar to the statutes passed by New York are
found in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Tennessee, Oklahoma,
Nebraska, South Dakota, Nevada, Idaho, Montana,
and Washington. In 1919, Michigan, Nebraska, Tennessee,
Montana, and Washington enacted statutes requiring that
all teachers of the public schools must be citizens of the
United States, and Idaho retained upon her statute books a
law of 1897 which had the same intent. The same action
was taken by North Dakota in 1921. In addition to those
engaged as instructors in the public schools, Nebraska included
teachers in private and parochial institutions. In
Washington, California and Michigan the privilege of a
license was granted to those aliens who declared their intention
of becoming citizens, and in Washington, there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
added to the proscribed group, those teachers whose certificates
or diplomas had been revoked on account of a failure
to impress upon the minds of the pupils “the principles of
patriotism or to train them up to a true comprehension of
the rights, duty, and dignity of American citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>An open declaration of loyalty and of an intention to inculcate
patriotism in their pupils was required of all teachers
by Ohio in a law of 1919, by Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma,
Oregon, and South Dakota in 1921. Ohio, Colorado, Oklahoma,
Arizona, and South Dakota made it incumbent upon
teachers not only in the public schools, but in private and
parochial schools, to take an oath to support the constitution
of the state and of the United States and to obey their laws.
Ohio insisted upon an “undivided allegiance to the government
of one country, the United States of America,” and
Colorado and Oregon sanctioned the same form.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Nevada
required of teachers the oath in her constitution, prescribed
for all public officers.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> In Oklahoma, any teacher violating
the law, or any person or officer paying out any school funds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
to a person teaching without subscribing to the oath, was
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon conviction such a
person was penalized by a fine of not less than one hundred
or more than five hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the
county jail from sixty days to six months, or both.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Oregon,
upon conviction, prescribed a maximum fine of one hundred
dollars for non-enforcement of the law.</p>

<p>In West Virginia, a law of 1923 has enjoined upon all
teachers, at the time of signing a yearly contract, an oath to
support the constitution of the United States and West
Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the regulations imposing an oath of allegiance
on teachers, South Dakota, like Washington, in her
law included a prohibition of treasonable utterances. “Any
teacher,” the law declared, “who shall have publicly reviled,
ridiculed or otherwise spoken or acted with disrespect and
contumacy towards the flag of the United States or its official
uniforms or insignia, or towards the system of government
of the United States, and its Constitution, or shall refuse to
take and subscribe to the oath of allegiance hereinbefore required,
shall thereafter forever be disqualified to teach in
any public or private school within this state, and the certificate
of any such teacher shall be revoked by the superintendent
of public instruction upon satisfactory proof of
the commission of any such offense.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>An Oklahoma statute has excluded from all public and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
private schools of that state persons “guilty of teaching or
inculcating disloyalty to the United States or of publicly
reviling the flag, or the system of government of the United
States.” Yet the statute prescribed that “criticism of any
public official shall not be construed as within the purview”
of this regulation. California, in a bill relating to American
histories and other textbooks which passed the Assembly in
1923, would have leashed her teachers in much the same
way. But the bill failed of passage in the Senate.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>The appropriation bill passed by the Sixty-Eighth Congress
for the District of Columbia, in 1925, provided that
no money should be available “for the payment of the salary
of any superintendent, assistant superintendent, director of
intermediate instruction, or supervising principal who permits
the teaching of partisan politics, disrespect for the
Holy Bible or that ours is an inferior form of government.”
A similar provision relates to teachers.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Two states, on the other hand, have passed laws emphasizing
a faith in the integrity and patriotism of their teachers.
Although their action preceded the legislation of the
World War, yet it is significant that there have been no restrictive
laws since then in these commonwealths. In 1911,
Pennsylvania sanctioned a policy of freedom of thought for
her teachers by declaring that “no religious or political test
or qualification” should be required of “any director, visitor,
superintendent, teacher, or other official, appointee, or
employee, in the public schools of this commonwealth.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
In 1913, the General Court of Massachusetts forbade any
school committee, by rule, regulation or other means to
restrain or penalize any teacher for “exercising his right of
suffrage, the signing of nomination papers, and the petitioning
or appearing before committees of the legislature”; but
it permitted school committees to forbid a teacher to exercise
any of the aforesaid rights, suffrage excepted, on school
premises during school hours or where the exercise interfered
with the performance of school duties.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Of great significance
was the Massachusetts law of March 17, 1917, which
expressly prohibited inquiries relative to the religious or
political belief of applicants for positions in the public
schools and forbade the rejection or selection of the applicant
on such grounds.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Many commonwealths, however, like New Jersey, have
enacted laws pertinent to teachers as citizens, but not openly
and avowedly “teacher” legislation. Such a law was approved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
February 13, 1918, by the governor of New Jersey.
It provided that “any person who shall advocate, in public
or private, by speech, writing, printing, or by any other
means, the subversion or destruction by force of the government
of the United States, or of the State of New Jersey, or
attempt by speech, writing, printing, or in any other way
whatsoever to incite or abet, promote or encourage hostility
or opposition to the government of the United States, or of
the State of New Jersey, shall be guilty of a high misdemeanor,
and on conviction shall be punished by imprisonment
for a term not exceeding ten years, or by a fine not
exceeding two thousand dollars, or by both fine and imprisonment,
in the discretion of the court.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>Of all legislation dealing with the teaching craft, that
which has attempted to control and direct the speech of the
teacher has provoked the greatest protest. Our political
development has been such that an interference with the
free expression of opinion creates the impression that a
jealously guarded right has been invaded. It is this feeling
which has led to an agitation against such laws, although
the fear that a teacher may be an instrument for corrupting
his pupils is not a product of recent times either in this
country or in world history.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>


<h4>FLAG LEGISLATION AND OBSERVANCE DAYS</h4>

<p>Legislation concerning the flag and special observance
days takes on the characteristics of other laws passed since
1917. One of the first “flag laws” was passed in 1918 by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
Maryland. This law declared as the purpose of its enactment
that “the love of liberty and democracy, signified in
the devotion of all true and patriotic Americans to their flag
and to their country, shall be instilled in the hearts and
minds of the youth of America.”<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Two years later, when
the tide of legislation for encouraging patriotism was at full
flood, a law embracing all schools through institutions of
higher learning passed the legislature. By this statute all
public and private schools, with the exception of professional
schools, were required to open their exercises “on at least
one day of each school week, whether morning, afternoon,
or evening, with the singing of the ‘Star Spangled Banner.’”<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Reverence and respect for the flag was the purpose of
Oklahoma’s statute in 1921. To insure obedience to the
law, which was applicable to all public, private, parochial
and denominational schools, the penalty of imprisonment or
a fine could be imposed upon an offender. “Any teacher,”
affirmed the law, “neglecting to display said flag or carry
out said ceremonial, or any person forbidding or hindering
the display of said flag or the carrying out of said ceremonial
shall be subject to discharge or removal and shall also be
punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars or
more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the
county jail for not less than sixty days and not more than six
months, or both.”<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Minnesota, in passing “An act to provide for the teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
in all the common, graded, and high schools of this state
of exercises tending to promote and inculcate patriotism,”
was actuated by a like motive in 1917. Here a half hour
daily must be devoted to patriotic exercises in all public
schools, and every teacher should, by special exercises and
by the teaching of subjects especially suitable, encourage and
inculcate the spirit of patriotism. Such exercises were to
consist of the singing of patriotic songs, readings from American
history and from the biographies of American statesmen
and patriots.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Of slightly different character was the agency for propagating
patriotism devised by the Alabama legislature in
1919, by which was established the “Alabama Patriotic
Society.” This organization, non-political and non-sectarian,
essayed as its objects “to stimulate patriotism among
the people; to teach the fundamental principles of American
institutions, or free government; to develop in the hearts
and minds of Alabamans a deeper love of country and reverence
for the American flag; to expound the underlying principle
of self-determination; to immortalize the heroes who
have brought fame and renown to Alabama by reason of
their courage and leadership in all the great wars, in which
Alabamans have engaged; to teach the people to love their
State, to respect her laws and to support the Constitution of
both the State and Federal Government; to bring the people
together to the end that unity of purpose and solidarity may
be promoted; to hold discussions of patriotic and political
questions affecting the general welfare of the whole people,
and to issue educational pamphlets and matter to aid in
carrying the purpose of the society fully into effect.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>In North Carolina, October twelfth has been set aside for
appropriate exercises in the public schools “to the consideration
of some topic or topics” of state history.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> In Oklahoma,
November sixteenth has been designated for a like
purpose in order to teach “loyalty and patriotism” to state
and Union.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Since 1918, the date November eleventh has become the
occasion for a commemoration of the general rejoicing which
was caused by the signing of the Armistice. In the state of
Washington, the law has ordained that it shall be “the duty
of each teacher in the public schools ..., or principal in
charge of the school building, to ... present a program of
exercises of at least sixty minutes in length, setting forth the
part taken by the United States and the state of Washington
in the world war for the years 1917-1918, and the principles
for which the allied nations fought, and the heroic
deeds of American soldiers and sailors, the leading events in
the history of our state and of Washington Territory, the
character and struggles of the pioneers, and other topics
tending to instill a loyalty and devotion to the institutions
and laws of our state.” West Virginia also has recognized
Armistice Day as a time fitting for “appropriate ceremonies.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>A joint resolution of the legislature of Maryland in 1920
memorialized the President of the United States to designate
November eleventh of each year as a day for national
thanksgiving. This day, the General Assembly believed,
had been “made sacred to the hearts of the American people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
in that it was the day on which the world’s greatest tragedy
was arrested and the awful pull at the people’s heart strings
relaxed,” and on which “there terminated that war which
overthrew the inhuman monster who laid blood-hands upon
nearly every home of a peace-blest earth.” The world was
further assured on this day, the lawmakers declared, that
“the struggle of democratic nations for liberty and for
righteousness had triumphed over the kultur and the crime
of the scientific barbarians, and that autocracy and diabolical
tyranny lay defeated and crushed behind the long rows
of white crosses which stretch across Europe....” The
legislators desired that the day should be the occasion for
“strengthening of those noble sentiments of patriotism common
to the American people, and to the love for the cause
for which the sons of Maryland fought and gave their lives
in the World War,” and it was recommended that the
schools observe the day in a “fitting and impressive manner.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>An act amending the law relating to holidays in Wisconsin,
in 1923 set aside Lincoln’s and Washington’s birthdays for
commemorative exercises in the public schools of that
state.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> North Dakota took similar action, adding October
twelfth and November eleventh for observance except in
communities where special exercises were held.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In Michigan,
in addition to observance days previously prescribed,
Roosevelt’s birthday, October twenty-seventh, and “Liberty
Day,” November eleventh, have been designated for “proper
and appropriate commemorative ceremonies.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>South Dakota, in 1921, declared that Memorial Day
should also be known as “Citizenship Day” in that state,
at which time each citizen who had become twenty-one years
of age during the year, or who had been admitted into full
citizenship of the United States during that period, should
receive a “citizenship certificate signed by the Governor,
attested by the Secretary of State, and countersigned by the
Chairman of the Board of County Commissioners of the
County in which such citizen resides.” The certificate included
the name, age, and residence of the citizen, who also
received a “manual of citizenship” containing “the Mayflower
Compact, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution
of the United States and of South Dakota,” and
“non-political axioms and discussions of the principles of
popular citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>Such laws were but the outpouring of a dynamic and enthusiastic
patriotism, and were considered by the legislator
another means of awakening and encouraging a love of
country.</p>


<h4>TEXTBOOK LEGISLATION</h4>

<p>Few states since 1917 have passed laws requiring a uniform
series of textbooks: North Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, and West Virginia. In all
of these states, except North Carolina, textbooks in local
history and in local and national civics were added to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
uniform series in United States history.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> In North Carolina
the state textbook commission was empowered to select
histories for the elementary grades.</p>

<p>The only other legislation of this period, except that designed
to censor the content of history textbooks, was the
resolution of the Georgia legislature of 1918. This resolution
endorsed the preparation of a suitable textbook in civil
government. It came from the State Board of Education,
who, in 1913, had condemned the textbook then in use and
had suggested the readoption of Peterman’s <i>Civil Government</i>,
temporarily, until one which would be satisfactory
could be prepared. From the action of the legislature in
1918, it is evident that no book had been written which met
the approval of the State School Book Commission. The
restatement of the resolve of 1913 merely sought to call
attention to the need for such a book.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The outstanding legislation of the period, which deals with
history textbooks, results from opening the flood-gates of
apprehension regarding the content of school histories. It
is the same misgiving which prompted restrictive legislation
regarding the speech of the teacher and required an open
avowal of allegiance to the government of the United States.
Here, again, the vital thing in the mind of the lawmaker is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
to repress any statements considered by him as likely to
undermine American patriotism.</p>

<p>In 1918, New York approved another Lusk law prohibiting
the use of any textbook which contained statements
seditious in character, disloyal to the United States or favorable
to the cause of any enemy country. The law created
a commission composed of the commissioner of education
and two persons designated by the Regents of the University
of the State of New York. To this body any person might
present written complaints against textbooks in “civics,
economics, English, history, language and literature,” which
were then to be examined “for the purpose of determining
whether such textbooks contain any matter or statements of
any kind which are seditious in character, disloyal to the
United States or favorable to the cause of any foreign country
with which the United States is now at war.”<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> In case
the commission disapproved of the book after examination,
the law prescribed that the reasons be forwarded to all
boards of education, who then must abandon the use of the
book. It was further provided that any person in authority
continuing to use a condemned book would be considered
guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>

<p>Less drastic legislation than the New York law was passed
in New Hampshire in 1921, declaring that “no book shall
be introduced into the public schools calculated to favor any
particular religious sect or political party.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Other legislation
which can be considered in the same category was
passed in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and California, in
their prohibition of “partisan and sectarian” books.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>During the years of 1922 and 1923, systematic efforts
were made by private organizations to control the content
of history textbooks. In general, the criticisms against the
histories then in use were directed by patriotic and racial
organizations seeking to revive the traditional treatment of
relations with Great Britain, particularly during the American
Revolution and the War of 1812.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>An outgrowth of this agitation against school histories
was the law of Wisconsin approved April 5, 1923. This
statute has prescribed that “no history or other textbook
shall be adopted for use or be used in any district school,
city school, vocational school or high school, which falsifies
the facts regarding the war of independence, or the war of
1812 or which defames our nation’s founders or misrepresents
the ideals and causes for which they struggled and
sacrificed, or which contains propaganda favorable to any
foreign government.” The law has also provided that a
complaint against any textbook filed by any five citizens
with the superintendent of public instruction, must be heard
within thirty days at the county seat of the county in which
the complainants reside. The statute has made it the duty
of the superintendent to pass upon the case ten days following
the hearing and to exclude from the schools any book
found to contain statements prohibited by the enactment.
In 1925, a bill embodying substantially the same spirit and
phraseology was presented to the Massachusetts House by
Mr. Garrity of Boston, but was not enacted into law.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Oregon has a similar law. The use of any textbook has
been prohibited which “speaks slightingly of the founders
of the republic, or of the men who preserved the Union, or
which belittles or undervalues their work.”<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1923, the Assembly of the state of California
passed a bill excluding from the schools of the state
any history or other textbook “which falsifies the facts regarding
the war of independence, the war of 1812, or any
other war of this country, or which defames our nation’s
founders, defenders, heroes or patriots, or misrepresents the
ideals and causes for which they struggled and sacrificed, or
misleads by stating but partial facts, or which contains
propaganda that is unfavorable to this country and government,
and favorable to any other government or other type
of government.” The bill met defeat in the Senate.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of 1923 a bill of like nature passed the
Senate of New York but failed in the Lower House. By
this proposal, known as the Higgins Bill, any American
history was prohibited in the primary or secondary schools
of the state, “which falsifies, distorts or denies the acts of
oppression recited in the Declaration of Independence, or
which, if a textbook dealing with the period immediately
preceding the Declaration of Independence, fails to refer,
... to the principal acts of oppression as set forth in the
Declaration of Independence.” It further forbade the use
of any history which “belittles, ridicules, doubts or denies
the services and sacrifices of American patriots,” or which
“emphasizes and enlarges upon the possible human failings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
or shortcomings of such patriots without giving at least
equal prominence to their virtues or merits.” The bill prescribed
for primary schools the presentation of episodes calculated
“to arouse in children a justifiable pride” in the
winning of “our national independence.” It further placed
under ban any textbook which “misrepresents” or “fails
to mention ... the compelling causes of the respective
wars waged ... against foreign interference, aggression or
encroachment, or which ... fails to emphasize ... the
final victory of the United States in any war it prosecuted
to a successful conclusion,” or which “belittles or ridicules
... American soldiers, sailors or marines in our wars
against foreign nations ... as to leave ... a contempt”
for them or “an unwarranted skepticism regarding their
successes under arms.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>A bill of like import was introduced in the New York
Senate in 1924. It included a provision for the training of
teachers in the best methods of teaching American history,
as well as the requirement that American history textbooks
include the Declaration of Independence “in its entirety,”
if dealing with the American Revolution.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> Senator Higgins
was also responsible for a resolution instructing the Commissioner
of Education to investigate the history textbooks
used in the schools of New York to ascertain whether any
contained matter misrepresenting events of the Revolution
or ridiculing the Revolutionary patriots.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1924, a bill relating to the selection of American
histories as textbooks and reference books in the public
schools was introduced into the Assembly of New Jersey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
It was designed to exclude any history which “belittles,
falsifies, misrepresents, distorts, doubts or denies the events
leading up to the Declaration of American Independence or
any other war in which this country has been engaged, or
which belittles, falsifies, misrepresents, distorts, doubts or
denies the deeds and accomplishments of noted American
patriots, or which questions the worthiness of their motives
or casts aspersions upon their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>A spirited protest against the bill as introduced in the
New Jersey Assembly came from the faculty of Princeton
University who resolved that “such legislation is in direct
contravention of the fundamental principles of freedom of
speech and of the press, and calculated to impair the integrity
of education in both the public and private institutions
in the State of New Jersey.”<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p><i>The New York Times</i> also objected to the censorship
proposed in that state, declaring that it was not conceivable
that “any honest man would wish to write textbooks in
history for children under such statutory prescription,” and
<i>The Freeman</i>, in an article regarding the Wisconsin law,
pointed out that “historians sometimes find it a difficult
matter to get at the truth in regard to the past, but for the
superintendent of schools in the state of Wisconsin it is no
job at all....”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>
<p>AMERICANIZATION OF FOREIGNERS</p>

<p>The desire to instil a knowledge of American institutions
has led to much legislation for the education of the foreign
element in our population. Some states have attempted to
eliminate illiteracy by evening classes for adults, by continuation
schools and like means. In all cases, the teaching
of the English language has been a primary purpose, as well
as training in a knowledge of American institutions. However,
not all Americanization laws have definitely stated the
purpose of training in citizenship, and therefore do not come
properly into this discussion.</p>

<p>Since 1917 more than one-third of the states have enacted
legislation for the purpose of developing a love for this country
in the foreign born.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> In that year, California inaugurated
the policy of “home teachers” to visit the homes of
pupils instructing both children and adults in matters pertaining
to “school attendance, sanitation, the English language,
and in the fundamental principles of the American
system of government and the rights and duties of citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
Two years later, this enactment was followed by
another law for the teaching of civic and vocational subjects
in evening classes, in which instruction was provided in the
“duties and responsibilities of citizenship” for those unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
to speak or read the English language to the proficiency of
the sixth grade.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> In 1921, California continued her Americanization
program by approving a law to provide for the
establishment of classes for training in citizenship for applicants
who had filed their declaration of intention to become
citizens of the United States and for other persons desiring
such instruction. The course of study includes the teaching
of United States history, state and community civics,
the “constitution of the United States with special reference
to those sections in the constitution which relate directly to
the duties, privileges and rights of the individuals, and such
allied subjects ... as shall properly prepare such applicants
to understand and assume the responsibilities of citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>In 1918, New York passed a law necessitating the attendance
of all non-English speaking and illiterate minors at
school or at classes established by employers in shops, stores,
factories, or plants in which were taught English and
civics.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> In 1921, it became a duty of the commissioner of
education to see that schools for the education of these illiterate
groups be established, in which should be taught “English,
history, civics, and other subjects tending to promote
good citizenship and increase vocational efficiency....”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>In Massachusetts, power has been granted to the director
of the division of immigration and Americanization, with the
approval of an advisory board, to employ methods which
will develop in the foreign born “an understanding of American
government, institutions and ideals.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>Arizona’s law of 1918 permitted the establishment of
night schools in school districts for those over sixteen who
were unable to read or write the English language, in which
there was to be instruction in “American ideals” and an
“understanding of American institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>The year 1919 saw the adoption of Americanization programs
by the legislatures of Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode
Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Minnesota, Oklahoma,
Utah, Montana and California in which the purpose of
teaching American ideals and institutions received express
mention.</p>

<p>Maine’s statute, designed for those persons “of normal
mentality over eighteen years of age who are unable to read,
to write, and to speak the English language to a reasonable
degree of efficiency,” prescribed the teaching of “the duties
of citizens in a democracy” and of “such other subjects as
will increase their civic intelligence.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In her legislation,
New Hampshire called for “the abolition of illiteracy and
the instruction of illiterates over sixteen years of age in the
common school branches and in the privileges, duties and
responsibilities of citizenship.” Immigrants over sixteen
years of age were to be taught “to appreciate and respect
the civic and social institutions of the United States,” and
to be instructed “in the duties of citizenship,” which are
“an essential part of public school education.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> In
Rhode Island, people between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one
years of age, unable to read and write English or to
speak it with reasonable facility, have been given the privilege
of a continuation school held for the purpose of teaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
the English language and American citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
Pennsylvania’s attempt to cope with the problem has led to
the passage of an act “to provide instruction in citizenship
and the principles of the government of the United States of
America and of this commonwealth to foreign-born residents
of the state of Pennsylvania, in the several counties thereof,
who are not required to attend the public schools of this
commonwealth.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>The Delaware law was designed for the foreign-born over
sixteen years of age not able to speak English, but who,
through evening classes, might be instructed in that language
and “in the institutions and forms of government of the
United States and the State of Delaware.”<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>An appropriation of the Minnesota legislature of 1919, to
carry out a provision of an Americanization law of 1917, became
available for work providing for instruction in English
for those whose knowledge is too limited to carry on business
or to read intelligently periodicals and newspapers, and in
the essential and vital facts of American history, American
government and ideals, and the duties and obligations of
citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>By a joint resolution of 1919 the Oklahoma legislature
created a committee on Americanization and made it incumbent
upon public school officials to organize classes in English
and in citizenship instruction wherever a petition signed
by ten residents of foreign birth over sixteen years of age
was presented to them.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> A minimum of two hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
hours of instruction during the school year aided Utah in
her Americanization program which included classes in the
“fundamental principles of the Constitution of the United
States, American history, and such other subjects as bear on
Americanization.”<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Montana’s legislation, designed for
those over sixteen years of age who were not familiar with
the English language, provided for instruction in “American
history and the Principles of Citizenship and any other
school subjects which the school trustees deem necessary for
the Americanization of the students enrolled.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>The Americanization movement was further aided by a
law approved April 19, 1920, in which New Jersey provided
instruction for the foreign born residents of her state, over
fourteen years of age, in English and “in the form of government
and the laws of this State and of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
American history, the Constitution of the United States, with
an exposition of the privileges and the duties of American
citizenship tending to produce a spirit of loyalty, were phases
of the Americanization programs of Ohio, Idaho, Wyoming,
and Oregon in 1921.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> In the last state, “home teachers,”
whose duty it is to instruct in the fundamental principles of
the American system of government and the rights and
duties of citizenship, were named as an aid in carrying on
the work of Americanization.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> In Michigan, the superintendent
of public instruction has been given power to provide
for the education of aliens and of native illiterates over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
eighteen years of age who are unable “to read, write and
speak the English language and who are unlearned in the
principles of government” of Michigan and of the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p>In general, the most popular means for educating the
alien population is by attendance at a night school, where,
through evening classes, teachers regularly employed in the
public schools seek to instruct in the English language and in
an appreciation of and respect for “the civic and social institutions
of the United States.” New York has tried the
employers’ school to effect the same purpose, whereas “home
teachers” are endorsed by California and Oregon. In the
four years preceding the outbreak of the World War,
5,174,701 immigrants came to the United States, of whom
22.1 were unable to read and write any language. In 1920,
nearly one and a half million, or 11 per cent, of the foreign-born
whites in this country could not speak English. For
this group, even more than for the native element, has it
seemed wise to encourage education, because it has become
a common belief that a lack of education endangers the well-being
of the state.</p>

examination upon the provisions and the principles of the Constitution
of the United States. <i>Laws</i> of Tennessee, 1923, ch. 17, sec. 2.
Washington, likewise, by an enactment of 1923, has prescribed United States history for a standard elementary certificate. <i>Laws</i> of Washington,
1923, p. 579. Florida, in 1923, enacted legislation requiring United
States history, including the Constitution of the United States for primary
and third grade certificates, civics for second grade, and general history, in
addition to the other social studies for a first grade license. <i>Compilation
of School Laws of Florida</i>, 1923, <i>Supplement</i>, pp. 4-5. Maryland, in 1922,
required United States and Maryland history and community civics for
elementary school certificates. <i>Maryland Public School Laws</i>, 1922, p. 40.

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br><span class="smcap">Disloyalty Charges Against Teachers Since 1917</span></h3></div>


<p>Great events occasion diverse opinions, and it is not
strange that the World War and its aftermath often tempted
public school teachers to enter the area of controversial
issues. Thus the question of whether the teacher should be
permitted free and open expression of opinion became a
point of contention between the upholders and opponents of
unrestricted speech. It became a matter of considerable
concern whether the teacher be allowed to sow the seed of an
idea alien to that held by the child’s parents, or, perhaps, in
disagreement with that of the school’s administrators. It
was not a new question nor unexpected.</p>

<p>The great mass of public school teachers were conscious
of the censorious eye fixed upon them and realized that “the
wise man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but the
foolish pass on and are punished.” Diligent search in public
records and through personal inquiry reveals few occasions
where actual charges of disloyalty were lodged against
teachers in the public schools. Indeed, the superintendents
of public instruction in thirty-two states report that from
1917 to 1924 no accusations involving the loyalty of teachers
were brought to the attention of their offices.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> One is
disposed to concur in a statement made by the Lusk Committee
of New York investigating seditious activities that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
“on the whole, it may safely be said that our public school
system is comparatively free from the taint of revolutionary
teaching.”<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Yet some teachers faced accusations impugning
loyalty. Doubtless there were others whose utterances
were considered disloyal or ill-advised, but who escaped with
little or no publicity attending their dismissal from service.</p>

<p>In the city of New York, the trials of teachers for disloyalty
were most numerous, for it was here that legislation
to restrain the speech of the teacher was most rigorously
applied. Under the Lusk Law persons failing to secure a
certificate of loyalty were forbidden to teach in the schools
of New York, the Commissioner of Education having the
sole right to refuse such a certificate.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>In general, charges of disloyalty were preferred against
six groups of teachers: those objecting to sign the pledge
of loyalty, those whose sympathies in the War were pro-German,
the pacifists, those whose speech was considered
disloyal, those who opposed and obstructed the draft, and
those who held membership in a political party which advocated
a change in the established form of government.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>In the eyes of the school administrators an unwillingness
to sign pledges of loyalty without qualification was but the
evidence of a hybrid patriotism. In no other light did they
believe could be considered the objection to a pledge which
declared an “unqualified allegiance to the Government of
the United States,” and which promised by “word and
example” to “teach and impress” upon “the pupils the
duty of loyal obedience and patriotic service as the highest
ideal of American citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Opposition to signing the pledges under compulsion was
led by the Teachers’ Union, and their protest against an
implication of disloyalty was endorsed by eighty-seven
teachers.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Among those refusing at first to sign a pledge
were Miss Isabel Davenport of the New York Training
School for Teachers and Harrison C. Thomas of the De
Witt Clinton High School. The examination started to
determine their fitness to teach was discontinued when they
agreed to sign the pledge.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1918, the charge of pro-Germanism was
lodged against Miss Gertrude A. M. Pignol, a teacher in
the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, and her
suspension was asked by the Board of Superintendents.
Miss Pignol, a native of Berlin, had been a resident of the
United States since 1905. In 1911 she had taken out
citizenship papers.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> When questioned by secret service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
agents, it developed that, although her sympathies were
with Germany, she had in no way been connected with
German activities in this country. In the hope that her
views might undergo a change Miss Pignol was given a
leave of absence for three months. In May, 1918, however,
Associate Superintendent Tildsley preferred the following
charges against her before a committee of the Board
of Education: that she did not believe in war, that she was
under the impression that it was not necessary for the
United States to be engaged in the War, that she would not
pledge her coöperation in every way in her power to the
United States government in its measures for the prosecution
of the War against Germany.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>In Miss Pignol’s trial, statements from fellow-teachers
were cited as proof of her pro-German bias. A remark,
alleged to have been made eleven years prior, that she
would be ashamed to be an American citizen, was adduced
as evidence. Further proof was found in a statement that
she doubted the accuracy of the accounts regarding German
outrages; that she had attempted to dissuade a
German woman from returning to Germany because she
would eat food needed by the Germans; that she objected
to the posting of a food card by the school librarian; and
that she was deeply touched by the slaughter of the War.
The possession of a locket, engraved by her father and
carrying the picture of the Kaiser’s grandfather on one side
and the cornflower on the other, was put in evidence as
additional proof of her hostility to the cause of the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Although she asserted her desire for an American
victory, the confession that she did not want her native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
land crushed militated against her.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> On June 26, she was
dismissed from service by the Board of Education.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>On October 24, 1918, Fritz A. E. Leuchs was suspended
from duty in the schools, charged with “conduct unbecoming
a teacher.” His suspension was confirmed on
October 30 by the Board of Education. According to his
own testimony, he had tried for four years to enlist in the
German army, but on October 25 had entered upon military
service in this country. Under the circumstances the
Board of Education resorted to suspension in order that
he could not claim the difference in pay as a teacher and
a soldier.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Similar treatment was accorded pacifists serving in the
schools. In this group was Miss Mary McDowell, a
Quakeress, employed in the schools of Brooklyn, who was
suspended from duty on March 12, 1918. She based
her defense in the unrestricted exercise of religious faith
as a birthright, her previous contributions to relief for
American sufferers to the Red Cross and other charitable
projects, as well as the distribution of thrift stamp circulars
in the schools. Miss McDowell’s retention as a public
school teacher was opposed on the ground that her pacifist
views were ill-advised at a time when patriotism should be
taught in act as well as in speech.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> On June 19, 1918,
she was dismissed from service by the Board of Education.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Following the close of the War Miss McDowell’s
case was reopened, which resulted in her reinstatement on
July 11, 1923. On reviewing the causes for Miss McDowell’s
dismissal, Commissioner Bowe declared: “After
full consideration of the case, the committee has decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
that the punishment meted out to Miss McDowell was
too severe. She was tried at a time of great public excitement.
Since then public feeling has undergone considerable
modification. For thirteen years she had done
excellent work as a teacher....”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>An unwillingness to engage in active service resulted likewise
in the suspension of Louis H. Blumenthal, a teacher of
history and civics in Public School 148, Brooklyn, on June
19, 1918.</p>

<p>Nor were all teachers willing to obey a law precluding
criticism of the government. To secure permanency of
tenure through silent assent was to some but a bribe against
their convictions. And not all were agreed that it was wise
to refrain from teaching what they held true because others
saw in the same belief the germs of disloyalty.</p>

<p>Such a disagreement as to how freely a teacher could
express opinions led to investigations of the loyalty of
Florence Levine, Samuel D. Schmalhausen, Thomas Mufson,
and A. Henry Schneer. In the case of Miss Levine, a
teacher in Public School 168, Brooklyn, the Teachers’ Council,
to whom the case had been referred, recommended that
she be admonished by the Acting Superintendent of Schools
so that thereafter she be careful in her public utterances,
but no charges were preferred against her.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>It was quite different in the cases of Mr. Schmalhausen,
Mr. Mufson, and Mr. Schneer. On November 13, 1917,
they were suspended from the faculty of the De Witt Clinton
High School for holding views considered not only subversive
to discipline in the schools but injurious to good
citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Their trials took place before a committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
of the Board of Education on December third, at which they
were represented by counsel. The charges against Mr.
Schmalhausen involved the writing of essays by his students,
in which, it was said, an unpatriotic attitude was permitted
to pass unchallenged by the teacher. According to the
testimony, the pupils were directed to write “An open letter
to the President” commenting frankly within the limits of
their knowledge upon his conduct of the War against the
German Government.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> Mr. Schmalhausen was also accused
of asserting that he did not consider it his duty “to develop
in the students under his control instinctive respect
for the President of the United States as such, for the
Governor of the State of New York as such, and other Federal,
State and Municipal officers as such.”<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>One of the themes, upon which attention at the trial was
focused, had been written by Hyman Herman, a Jewish
student sixteen years of age. It was addressed “to the Defender
of Humanity and Champion of Democracy, Woodrow
Wilson.” In his testimony Mr. Schmalhausen asserted
complete ignorance of this essay until it was called to his
attention in an interview with Associate Superintendent
Tildsley two weeks after it had been written.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>In the theme the writer propounded such questions as the
following: “But how is it that the United States, a country
far from democratic (and daily proving itself to be such)
and England, the imperial and selfish (and we exclude all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
minor participants) undertake to slam democracy upon a
nation whether it likes it or not? What unparalleled audacity
to attempt to force 70,000,000 people to adopt a
certain kind of government. If we mean their benefit, then
the Germans surely know what they want and need us
not....</p>

<p>“... Finally if our aim be the annihilation of Prussianism,
then why in the name of Heaven have you refused the
offer made by Germany, which included the evacuation of
Belgium, disarmament of nations and freedom of the seas?
Surely then your purpose is to get supreme domination and
to crush Germany for no reason it seems, except a mad
desire for murder, meanwhile making us the goats.”<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Schmalhausen had annotated the theme, after it had
been placed in his hands by Dr. Tildsley, with such statements
as “irrelevant,” “not accurately presented,” and “for
a thoughtful student this statement sounds irrational.”<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
The defense contended that such annotations were sufficient
to prove Mr. Schmalhausen’s disapproval of the sentiments
expressed, but the prosecution argued that his failure to denounce
them openly indicated his lack of loyalty.</p>

<p>As a witness for Mr. Schmalhausen, Herman, the author
of the theme, testified that he had not received his impressions
of this country’s attitude toward war questions in any
sense from Mr. Schmalhausen, although since the time of
writing the theme he had changed his attitude due to a study
of his history textbook<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and the attitude of his history
teacher.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>In turn, Mr. Schmalhausen, defending his own patriotism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
declared that President Wilson’s “interpretation, his attitude,
his points of view in relation to the war for democracy”
met with his “complete intellectual approval,” and
that, although he had opposed the policy of conscription
instead of a volunteer system, when adopted, he had complied
with the request of the Government, as did others
within the proper ages.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>The second instructor in the De Witt Clinton High School
who was arraigned before the Board of Education on December
third was Thomas Mufson, charged with thinking it
proper to be neutral while his class debated such subjects as
the purchase of Liberty Bonds, the active support of the
Government in various measures for carrying on the War,
the wisdom of an early peace, and the relative merits of
anarchism and the form of the government of the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Mufson defended himself against these charges on
the ground that he was not justified in imposing personal
views upon his classes on controversial subjects. Furthermore,
he said that he would not permit a discussion of
anarchism in his classroom, a topic he held far too difficult
for immature minds.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>The specific charges brought against Mr. Schneer arose
from statements it was alleged he had made regarding patriotism
and the wearing of the uniform of the United States
army. It was held that he was opposed to discussing
patriotism in the schoolroom and that he objected to persons
wearing the uniform when speaking before the school, because
it tended to encourage militarism.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> All of the
charges Mr. Schneer denied, protesting his loyalty to school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
and national authorities, and citing as proof, among other
things, the signing of the loyalty pledge of the Board of
Education.</p>

<p>Considerable discussion by the public and by teachers
attended these trials. Among those commending the Board
of Education for their vigilance were the Schoolmasters’
Association of New York and Vicinity, who adopted a resolution
expressing the hope that efforts to suppress disloyal
influences in the schools would be energetically sustained.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
On the other hand, the Teachers’ Union voted to give the
teachers on trial their “legal, moral and financial support,”<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
and eleven college teachers requested that the decision
against them be delayed for further investigation.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Professor
John Dewey was reported to have likened the trial to
“the Inquisition,”<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> and the New York <i>Evening Post</i>
editorially declared that “the case not only was prejudiced
from the beginning, but was disingenuous in inception, unfair
in method and un-American in spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> On December
19, 1917, these teachers were dismissed by the Board of
Education.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> Later their appeal for reinstatement was denied
by the Commissioner of Education.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>In November, 1917, six other teachers of the De Witt
Clinton High School were transferred to other schools because
lacking a positive loyalty. Friends of the teachers
ascribed their transfer to their “independence” and not to
a lack of loyalty.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The absence of academic freedom and
democracy in school organization, an indefiniteness in the
charges preferred against them, were all advanced by the
teachers themselves in extenuation of their acts.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> According
to a statement of <i>The New York Times</i>, in the inquiry
to determine their fitness to teach, the teachers declared they
had been asked such questions as the following: “Should
not a teacher inculcate instinctive obedience to supervisors,
no matter what the acts of the superior officers may be?
What is your opinion of the Bolsheviki? Do you believe in
revolution? Are teachers qualified to criticise superiors?
Do you believe in internationalism? Do you think a teacher
ought to impose his views on pupils? Is there not a presumption
that whatever is, is right? Would you rather have
Hillquit or Roosevelt for mayor? What would you do if a
boy called President Wilson a murderer? Do you accept
Hillquit’s treasonable utterances? Does not the critical
attitude in children need suppression? Would you be willing
for the boys in your class to discuss Liberty Bonds pro
and con? In the matter of the longer day should the teachers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
have been consulted?”<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> That the teachers were asked
these questions was stoutly denied by Superintendent William
L. Ettinger.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Closely allied with charges of disloyal speech were those
growing out of attempts to obstruct the government in its
prosecution of the War. Of such a nature was the charge
brought against Miss Fannie Ross, a teacher in Public
School 88, Brooklyn, who, while acting as a registrar in the
state census, was reported to have expressed opposition to
the draft, to have given advice outside her line of duty, and
to have gone so far as to influence a man to claim exemption.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
On December 26, 1917, Miss Ross was suspended
from service for six months because of “conduct unbecoming
a teacher,” due “to tactless remarks.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>The apprehension of the school authorities of New York
City was further reflected in the trial of teachers who were
suspected of radical views. This anxiety expressed itself
in the withholding of certificates of loyalty and morality at
least during the investigation. Following the War, membership
in the Socialist Party, advocacy of Communism, and
a sympathetic attitude toward the Bolshevist program of
Russia were the chief charges preferred in the trials.</p>

<p>Among the first teachers summoned before the high school
committee of the Board of Education because of radical
views was Harrison C. Thomas, a teacher in the De Witt
Clinton High School. Mr. Thomas was an advocate of internationalism
and of socialism, a conscientious objector
who had been excused from the draft, and avowedly not
enthusiastic over wartime enterprises like Liberty Bonds.
When questioned regarding his attitude in the classroom, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
confessed that he would not conceal the fact that he was an
objector; that he believed resistance to aggressiveness by
force wrong; and that if Germany wanted to rule this country
submission would be better than forceful resistance.
Yet he declared that he had tried to get into reconstruction
work in France and that he would do anything except fight.
As a result, his certificate of morality and loyalty was withheld.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
Similar action was taken in the case of Bernard M.
Parelhoff, of the George Washington High School, who maintained
that a nation which “teaches patriotism in its schools
is merely driving nails into its own coffin,” and because he
believed there should be no reverence for the uniform as
such.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>Licenses were likewise withheld from other teachers,
among whom were Eugene Jackson, Austin M. Works, Garibaldi
Lapolla, Abraham Lefkowitz, Edward Delaney, and
Wilmer T. Stone of the De Witt Clinton High School; Ruth
G. Hardy of the Girls’ Commercial High School; John J.
Donohue, Louis A. Goldman, Felix Sper and John J. Shipley
of the Stuyvesant High School; Max Rosenhaus of the
Bushwick High School; Alexander Fichlander of Public
School 165, Brooklyn; and Henrietta Rodman, Benjamin
Gruenberg, and Benjamin Mandel of the Julia Richman
High School.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The action of the authorities in withholding certificates of
loyalty from some of these teachers called forth a protest
from Dr. Henry Linville of the Teachers’ Union, of which
many of the accused were members. Dr. Linville assailed the
methods employed in the investigations and the reasons for
which certificates were being withheld. He asserted that
during the War these teachers had been unmolested by the
federal government and had not been summoned to face
charges of disloyalty by the school authorities. Although
non-conformists in relation “to static views of society and
politics,” he declared that “most of them actively supported
all war enterprises, a minority only being pacifist in belief
and action.”<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> Moreover, in denial of the charge that
teachers of alleged radical views were indoctrinating their
pupils with minority and undesirable opinions, he declared
that none of these teachers had ever maintained the right
of a teacher to press upon the pupils the political views that
he himself held.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>But the authorities throughout were insistent in their
desire to rid the schools of all teachers holding a political
belief which to them was anathema. To this end in November,
1919, a permanent license was denied Miss Sonia Ginsberg,
of Public School 170, because she admitted membership
in the Communist Party;<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> for the same reason action
was taken against Miss Rachel (Ray) Ragozin, in February,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
1921;<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> and in February, 1922, resolutions were adopted by
the Board of Education directing the Superintendent of
Schools to reprimand Miss Sarah Hyams for signing the
membership card of the Left Wing of the Socialist Party.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
For advocating the reading of an article on Bolshevism, in
November, 1919, Associate Superintendent Tildsley recommended
that a permanent license be refused Benjamin Horwitz,
a teacher of English in the De Witt Clinton High
School.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>The suspicion that Benjamin Glassberg, a teacher of history
in the Brooklyn Commercial High School, was preaching
the doctrines of Bolshevism led to his suspension from
service in January, 1919. Among the objections raised
against Mr. Glassberg as a teacher were statements alleged
to have been made by him to the effect that a teacher in the
public schools was not allowed to tell the truth, that the
State Department did not permit true reports to be given
about conditions in Russia, and that Red Cross workers
were forbidden to express true opinions regarding that country.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>At his trial before the Board of Education on May 9,
1919, Mr. Glassberg confessed that he had quoted from
several noted Bolshevists in reply to a question whether
Lenine and Trotsky were German spies. He declared that
the statements with which he was charged were in answer
to questions asked by his class and not as “a lecture laudatory
of the Bolsheviki and severely critical of the Government
of the United States.” In regard to the remark about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
freedom of speech in the public schools he asserted complete
innocence.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> On May 29, 1919, Mr. Glassberg was
dismissed from service.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>Considerable discussion attended the trials of the New
York City teachers. To some there was no substantial
foundation upon which to base charges of disloyalty, and the
question resolved itself into whether a teacher need forfeit
his rights to a political faith in which he believed. The
answer of the school authorities came in the statement of
Dr. John L. Tildsley, Associate Superintendent of Schools:
“No person who adheres to the Marxian program, the program
of the Left Wing of the Socialist Party in this country,
should be allowed to become a teacher in the public school
system, and if discovered to be a teacher, should be compelled
to sever his connection with the school system, for it
is impossible for such a person to carry out the purpose
of the public schools ... [the purpose] that the public
schools of any country should be the expression of the country’s
ideals, the purpose of its institutions, and the philosophy
of its life and government.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>But even in the eyes of the New York City school authorities
the great mass of public school teachers were loyal, for
out of approximately twenty-five thousand employed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
system less than half a hundred were called to account for
the views they held.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Outside of the city of New York other cases of alleged
infringement of the Lusk Law occurred. Among these was
that of P. Hiram Mattingly, of Poughkeepsie, dismissed
from the schools because at a Socialist meeting he characterized
the Espionage Law as a measure of despotism, and
declared that it was time that the republic be restored to
this country, a first step toward which would be the acceptance
of a Socialist administration in that city.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>Membership in the Communist Party cost Miss Julia D.
Pratt her position as a music teacher in Buffalo in 1921. In
passing upon her case, Frank B. Gilbert, deputy commissioner
and counsel of the State Department of Education, set
forth the opinion of those with whom final judgment rested
when he declared: “A teacher in the public schools is a
member of a state system and a servant of the people of the
state. A teacher cannot properly perform the duties of her
position and give expression, either verbally or by affiliation
with any political or other organization, to her belief that
our present government should be overthrown by revolution
or by force and violence through direct action by any group
or class....”<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>Teachers beyond the confines of New York suffered
similar penalties, although the hand of the law did not press
so heavily upon them. They, too, found it necessary to
guard their speech and to abstain from proscribed political
tenets, or else pay the price of reprimand or dismissal. Precisely
this kind of a condition was brought forcibly upon
the teachers of Washington, D. C., in the spring of 1919,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
when one of their members—Miss Alice Wood—was suspended
for a week without a hearing, charged with discussing
“Bolshevism and other heresies” in her classroom.
Among the topics which Miss Wood later found forbidden
was that of the League of Nations.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion made by a supervisor of primary education
in Des Moines, Iowa, that a blind patriotism might be
fostered through the selection of songs and poems narrowly
patriotic led to an investigation of her Americanism by the
commander of the Sons of Veterans.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>Since 1917, however, in only twelve states besides New
York cases involving disloyalty charges have been brought
before the office of the state department of education. In
Delaware, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, North
Carolina and South Dakota the charges resulted in the dismissal
of teachers. In California, Maine, Minnesota,
Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota and South Dakota,
although charges were preferred against teachers the cases
were dismissed for insufficient evidence.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>In Montana, school authorities in some cases failed to
reappoint teachers at the end of the year because of alleged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
objectionable “utterances,” although “no proof of disloyalty
was ever made positive.” The Department of Public
Instruction of Indiana reported “a few instances” in
that state where positions were lost because of disloyalty
charges.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>In Louisiana, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction
reported the revocation of a man’s certificate because
“he capitalized the patriotism which ran high in his community,
to lend money to a number of small farmers in
the community for use in purchasing War Savings Stamps
and Liberty Bonds, and for the use of which he charged an
exorbitant rate of interest.” The teacher was said to have
bought “no stamps or Liberty Bonds,” and boasted that he
could make more money by lending to “the suckers in the
community than by buying the low-interest paying Federal
obligations.” This state also revoked the certificate of a
woman whose religious scruples forbade her endorsement of
the War and whose zeal led her to advise against the purchase
of Liberty Bonds.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p>North Carolina’s case of dismissal was that of a county
superintendent charged with pro-Germanism shortly after
the entrance of the United States into the War. Although
most of the pro-German utterances of this man had been
made prior to the declaration of war by the United States,
the County Board of Education held that his influence and
usefulness had been lessened and therefore asked his resignation.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>In Rhode Island “disclosures of thoroughly organized
preparation to cultivate in the United States a public opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
favorable to Pan-Germanic aspirations for world empire
led, during the War, to several investigations for the purpose
of determining to what extent and through what agencies
propaganda either hostile to America and to American ideals,
or tending insidiously to undermine democratic institutions,
had been conducted.”<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> At the request of the Governor,
the Commissioner of the Public Schools undertook an investigation
of the loyalty of public and private school teachers.
Questionnaires containing the following questions were
dispatched to the proper authorities:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To what extent, if any, have teachers under your observation,
in the classroom or out of it, been</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Active in promoting German propaganda?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Active in promoting anti-American propaganda?</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Disloyal in word, deed, or manner to nation or state?</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Disrespectful of law and public authority?</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Passive or indifferent with reference to patriotism?</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Cynical in their discussion of democracy, or in their discussions
of history, or in their general attitude toward American
public probity?</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Teaching that democracy and democratic institutions are
crude and inefficient?”</p>
</div>

<p>In turn, the Commissioner of the Public Schools pointed
out that “while a few teachers have not fully recognized
their civic obligations in giving instruction, or have failed
to realize the relation of public education to loyal citizenship,
or have been remiss in upholding American ideals, the
ardent patriotism of the many and their larger activities as
noted by the committee of inquiry attest the civic loyalty
of our teachers in our schools.” He assured the public that
“no disloyal teacher” would “be suffered to teach.”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>This insistence upon conformity among teachers bounded
on all sides their freedom of speech. It was readily and
unquestioningly accepted by the great majority. It sprang
from the belief that the teacher as an employee of the government
should always agree with the government. The
advocate of repression and control held that the public
school should never be a haven where personal opinions
could leaven the book-lore which was prescribed by authority.
Others agreed with Zechariah Chafee that there was
not only an individual but a social interest in free speech,
that between that individual interest and the social interest,
the former should always give way, that freedom of speech
meant liberty, not license; but that freedom of speech in
itself was a social interest, and that one of the purposes for
the existence of society was the discovery and spread of
truth, a purpose which could be accomplished only by permitting
teachers to think for themselves.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>The public school deals with that period of life in which
strong impressions find easy lodgment in the child’s memory.
Altruism, glorification of national achievements, hero worship,
and other emotions are excited by contacts with teachers
and books. It is the age in which the child’s ideals can
be fired by the sayings of famous men and in which the
story of valorous deeds stirs a responsive enthusiasm. Indeed,
it is a common belief that the influences of these early
associations and impressions persist far into maturity, for
“as the twig is bent, so the tree is inclined.” With a keen
appreciation of the possibilities of this plastic period of
child life, authors of textbooks in history and the other
social studies, obedient to the spirit of their times, have
exalted and condemned as the prevailing temper has dictated.</p>

<p>History for the sake of propaganda is not a unique possession
of any one country. It has been employed in the name
of “patriotism” by many nations. Livy extolled Rome,
Green exalted England, Bancroft eulogized the exploits of
the founders of America, and Treitschke and Nietzsche pictured
the glories of an imperialist régime in Germany. As
a result, there has developed an overweening pride in
national and racial attributes and achievements. From such
a source has sprung much of the hereditary enmity between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
France and Germany. Indeed, it has been said that an
analogous situation exists in the United States, and a well-known
writer recently declared that, through the study of
American history, “Americans are taught to hate Britishers,
... and not only descendants of the men who made
the Revolution, but every newly arrived immigrant child
imbibes the hatred of Great Britain of today from the patriotic
ceremonies of the public schools.”<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Propagandist history, however, is not merely an instrument
of the ultra-nationalist. By the pacifist it may be
employed to depict with a vivid gruesomeness the horrors
of war; by it the militarist may demonstrate the advantages
of preparedness; the racially conscious may narrate, in
their history, achievements of their heroes to the exclusion
or derogation of those of other groups; the religious enthusiasts
may commend the contributions of their sect to
the neglect of others; and economic and social organizations
may seek to serve their particular purposes. Demands for
revised history textbooks, such as emanated during the
World War, to teach the point of view then current, are but
a recent instance of a practice as old as the teaching of
history.</p>


<h4>HISTORY TEXTBOOKS IN THE SOUTH</h4>

<p>In the United States, as well as elsewhere, propagandist
influences have played their part in shaping the content of
history textbooks. The South, in particular, has shown such
tendencies, attempting in the <i>ante-bellum</i> days to propagate
a history favorable to the slave-holding interests, and since
that time endeavoring to justify the past in the eyes of
posterity. The desire to depict events from a sectional
point of view was especially apparent in the decade preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the Civil War when a concerted effort to prescribe the
content of history textbooks expressed itself in frequent
agitations against the use of Northern textbooks. By the
Southerner was raised the same query which has been raised
in our own time—whether the author of a textbook has a
right “to step aside from his proper course to drag in his
own private views on vexed questions of national import”
about which a writer should “maintain an impartial stand.”<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
Such criticisms were directed against Northern textbook
writers; for Southerners were agreed that an author would
not be guilty of a heinous offense if he should “step aside
... to drag in” views favorable to the institution of
slavery. Indeed, a sectional presentation of history was
deemed a necessity; and a movement for “home education”
to combat the teachings of the “abolitionist North” attained
considerable vigor in the ’fifties. To the Southerner, “home
education” meant Southern trained teachers and textbooks
filled with the convictions of the slave-holding South.
Through such agencies it was hoped to expel from their
midst “the wandering incendiary Yankee school-master”
with “his incendiary school books”<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> parading under “the
black piratical ensign of abolitionism.”<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Even prior to the ’fifties, the South had realized the value
of a propagandist literature, for Duff Green, a relative of
John C. Calhoun, had secured a charter from South Carolina
for a Southern Literary Company for the purpose of
publishing school books adapted to his section.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Green’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
efforts must have proved unsuccessful, for it was followed
by much newspaper discussion of the situation, which
gained in asperity as the South became more belligerent in
the assertion of her rights.</p>

<p>Writing in <i>De Bow’s Review</i> of 1855, one alarmist declared:
“Our text-books are abolition works. They are so
to the extent of their capacity, and though the poison of
anti-slavery dogmas has not found its way into arithmetic
and mixed mathematics, yet we should not be surprised to
find that some work is now in progress in which the young
learner will find his sums stated in abolition phrases, and
perhaps be required to tell how many more sinners might
have gone to Heaven if Abraham, the ‘father of the faithful
and the friend of God’ had not been a slave holder and a
dealer in human chattels; ... and so long as we use such
work as Wayland’s <i>Moral Science</i> and the abolition geographies,
readers and histories, overrunning as they do, with
all sorts of slanders, caricatures and blood-thirsty sentiments
... [they will] array our children by false ideas, against
the established ordinances of God,....”<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Another writer could not condone the indifference of his
section to the existence of such conditions. “When the
public mind of our section was divided as to the justice and
propriety of this institution [slavery] ...,” he remarked,
“it was not then to be wondered at that we should remain
indifferent to the views presented to our youth on the subject,
and that we should carelessly allow them to peruse,
even in their tender years, works in which slavery was denounced
as an unmitigated evil, and the universal race of
Ham’s descendants were blazoned forth as a set of dusky
angels and martyrs. Such a course may have been defensible
at that period, but tell me, what show of propriety is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
there in its continuance at the present day? We have become
awake to the rightfulness and justice of our stand;
we have come to know that we are more sinned against than
sinning; and we have witnessed the complete failure of many
quixotic attempts to transform negroes into prosperous and
thriving freemen. Why then should we wish that the rising
generation, who are to frame and control public opinion,
after we have passed from being, should be on this question
of vital importance taught doctrines which are in direct
conflict with what we now believe?”<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>Because “southern life, habits, thoughts, and aims” were
“so essentially different from those of the North,” another
protagonist of “home education” maintained that a different
character of books and training was required to “bring
up the boy to manhood with his faculties fully developed.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
Nor could this “true man” be developed if he must sit “at
the feet of some abolition Gamaliel of the North,” but he
must have “books and teachers of history from the South
who should point out the destiny of the South.”<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>As a result of the agitation of the press, the commercial
conventions, which met during the years from 1853 to 1860,
committed themselves with one accord, to the Southern
educational program. The Memphis Convention of 1853
demanded the employment of native teachers, the encouragement
of a home press, and the publication of books adapted
to the educational wants and the social conditions of the
section.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> The following year, the Charleston Convention
passed a resolution which urged the production of textbooks
by Southern men “with express reference to the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
education of the Southern youth.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> The resolution declared
that “this Convention earnestly recommends all
parents and guardians within these states, to consider well,
that to neglect the claims of their own seminaries and colleges,
and patronize and enrich those of remote states, is
fraught with peril to our sacred interests, perpetuating our
dependence on those who do not understand and cannot
appreciate our necessities and responsibilities; and at the
same time fixing a lasting reproach upon our institutions,
teachers and people.”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>In 1856, the Savannah Convention issued to “The People
of the Slaveholding States” an address advocating joint
action on the part of the Southern legislatures. “It will be
well, at least, to look to our school books,” they declared.
“Can the making of these be entrusted exclusively to those,
who by instilling an occasional heresy, dangerous to our
repose, imagine that they serve at the same time God and
Mammon—their consciences and their pocket? The State
Legislatures at the South alone are competent to heal this
mischief. Property will submit to any amount of taxation
for such a purpose. A system can and ought to be matured
at the South by which the most ample encouragement shall
be given to its educational system and its press. Withdraw
at once the contributions which are returned too often to us
now in contumely and insult.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>At the same convention the committee upon the subject
of “Text Books for Southern Schools and Colleges” reported
that “the books rapidly coming into use in our
schools and colleges at the South are not only polluted with
opinions adverse to our institutions, and hostile to our constitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
views, but are inferior in every respect, as books
of instruction to those which might be produced amongst
ourselves, or procured from Europe....”<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> The Committee
proposed that the convention take the matter “under
their auspices and select or prepare such a series of books,
in every department of study, from the earliest primer to
the highest grade of literature and science, as shall seem to
them best qualified to elevate and purify the education of
the South.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> The Committee further recommended that
“when this series of books shall have been prepared, the
Legislatures of the Southern States be requested to adopt
them as text-books.”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>The committees appointed at the Southern conventions
evidently failed to obtain results, for <i>De Bow’s Review</i> of
1858 querulously remarked that the committees seemed to
have dropped into repose after their appointments.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Newspaper
agitation, however, continued without abatement, <i>The
Constitutionalist</i> suggesting, in 1858, that Georgia by law
should compel her schools to use Georgia school books in
which information was given regarding the early history of
the state, and which contained “eloquent and patriotic
emanations from the gifted pens” of some of their “ablest
writers.”<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>History textbooks held a conspicuous place in most of the
discussions. Peter Parley’s <i>History</i>, extensively used at this
time, came in for much adverse criticism because, in the
opinion of the Southerner, it “insulted” and “misrepresented”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the institutions of the South.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> “If it is important
for us to have a home literature of our own in the lighter
departments of reading and knowledge,” one critic remarked,
“how much more vitally essential it is to our best interests
that the books from which our children imbibe their earliest
lessons in history and political economy should be written
by those who are able to expound and vindicate, instead of
misrepresenting and defaming the institutions under which
they are to live and be educated.”<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p>Further criticism of the same textbook is found in an
article on “Wants of the South” in <i>De Bow’s Review</i> for
1860. “Our schools have long been groaning under the
burden of questionable orthodoxy, and in some instances
decided hostility to the institutions which her public instructors,
of all others, may reasonably be expected to advocate
and defend,” said one writer. “... no teacher or pupil
who has used Peter Parley’s Histories, or any of the popular
‘Readers’ and ‘Orators’ from which juvenile disciples of
Demosthenes have learned to spout so glibly eloquent invectives
against slavery, the slave trade, will fail to recognize
the long-deplored existence of this deadly evil.”<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p>Other books of an historical nature, which were especially
obnoxious to the South, were Gilbert’s <i>Atlas</i> and Appleton’s
<i>Complete Guide of the World</i>, which contained “hidden
lessons of the most fiendish and murderous character that
enraged fanaticism could conceive or indite.”<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> “This book
and many other northern school books scattered over the
country come within range of the Statutes of this State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
[Louisiana], which provide for the imprisonment for life
or the infliction of a penalty of death upon any person who
shall publish or distribute such works ...,” declared one
writer.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Whelpley’s <i>Compend of History</i> was also considered
heretical in nature because of its discussion of slavery, which
inculcated “improper precepts in the minds of our children.”<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
The writer in his diatribe against this book quoted
the following passage from Whelpley to prove his point:
“But for what purpose was he [the slave] brought from his
country? Why was he forced from the scenes of his youth,
and the cool retreats of his native mountains? Was it, that
he might witness the saving knowledge of the gospel?...
No. He was deprived of his <i>freedom</i>, the dearest pledge of
his existence. <i>His mind was not cultivated and improved
by science!... He is detested for his complexion, and
ranked among the brutes for his stupidity.</i> His laborious
exertions are extorted from him to enrich his purchasers,
and <i>his scanty allowance is furnished, only that he may
endure his sufferings for their aggrandizement</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p>

<p>The discussion of slavery in the Northern textbooks was
not the only cause for irritation. Equally distasteful to the
Southerner were the invidious comparisons made between
North and South.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> The histories produced by the North,
one writer pointed out, “are filled with praise and glorification
of the New England and Northern states generally, as
a set of incorruptible patriots, irreproachable moralists, and
most exemplary models for future imitation, and their descendants
are depicted as fully equalling the standard set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
for them by their distinguished ancestors, of unexceptionable
demeanor. On the other hand, the individuals who
organized society in the Southern States are pictured as a race
of immoral reprobates, who have handed down all of their
vices and evil habits to their descendants of this day. While
the institution of slavery and its introduction into our country
are made the occasion of much violent invective, there
is but a slight effort at rebuke, and a large amount of apology
is offered, for the amusements of burning witches, hanging
Quakers, and banishing Baptists, formerly so very popular
in New England. While we, who now support and defend
the institution of slavery, are either denounced or pitied,
the residents of the Northern States, who have always been
the chief prosecutors of the slave trade are allowed to pass
uncensured. Such is the state of the histories.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>To Willson’s <i>Historical Series</i> objection was raised because
“the author has elected to make himself sectional and
therefore must expect sectional support.” “Why say of the
odious Hartford Convention,” a critic remarked, “‘Its proceedings
were not as objectionable as many anticipated,’ or
why use comparisons between the different sections as invidious,
and as we believe and know, as false as these: ‘In
Virginia and the southern colonies, where the inhabitants
guided in the selection of their dwelling places chiefly by
consideration of agricultural conveniences, dispersed themselves
over the face of the country, often at considerable
distances from each other, schools and churches were necessarily
rare, and social intercourse but little known. The
evils of the state of society thus produced still exist to a considerable
extent in the southern portions of the Union. The
colonization of New England was more favorable to the improvement
of human character and morals.’” Further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
cause for complaint lay in the following passage: “Of the
state of manners and morals in Maryland, Virginia and the
southern colonies generally, we cannot give so gratifying an
account. While the upper classes of inhabitants among the
southern people were distinguished for a luxurious and expensive
hospitality, they were too generally addicted to the
vices of card playing, gambling and intemperance, while
hunting and cock-fighting were favorite amusements of persons
of all ranks.... It cannot be denied, however, that
New England colonial history furnishes, on the whole, the
most agreeable reminiscences, as well as the most abundant
materials for the historian.”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>So common was a biased presentation of controversial
questions in the books of the time that William Howard
Russell, <i>The</i> [London] <i>Times</i> correspondent during the Civil
War, declared that he was unable to obtain “a single solid,
substantial work” on the controversy between the North
and the South, for there was not one published which was
“worth a cent.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<p>Little response to the exponents of “home education”
seems to have been made at this time by the state legislatures,
although, in 1859, the Louisiana legislature adopted
a resolution endorsing the movement “to encourage the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of and introduction into the schools of Louisiana of
a series of school books written by citizens of the State,
published in the South, not contaminated by the fanaticism
of Northern authors.”<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Other Southern states
since the Civil War have prescribed the type of histories
to be used in their schools, but they have had for their
chief intent a “proper presentation of the War of the
States.”</p>

<p>Since the Civil War the most active exponents of a pro-Southern
history have been Southern veterans’ associations
and kindred groups. Especially vigilant have been the
United Confederate Veterans who, since 1892, with few
exceptions have announced in annual convention their advocacy
of “a true and reliable history.” In 1892, the first
historical committee, composed of “comrades skilled and
experienced in such matters,” was appointed to “select
proper and truthful histories of the United States to recommend
for use in the public and private schools of the
South.”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> No meeting of the Veterans was held in 1893,
but the following year the Historical Committee offered an
extensive and elaborate report.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> This report suggested
the establishment of a chair of American history in Southern
universities with time for research; that the Association
recommend to the legislatures of Southern states that provision
be made in the public school course for the teaching
of history of the native state for one year, and for the establishment
and support of a chair of American history in
the state university or some suitable state institution, and
that the preparation of school histories of the state be encouraged;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
that all private schools and academies teach the
history of the state one year and devote the same amount
of time to United States history; and that state legislatures
be memorialized in order to gain their coöperation in securing
“a different presentation of the narrative of facts for
the truth of history of our common country.”<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>The Committee, besides their recommendations, classified
school histories in three groups. In the first class were
those issued in the first ten or fifteen years following the
close of the War, “dictated by prejudice and prompted by
the evil passion that time had not then softened.” Secondly
came those Northern histories apparently fair, either through
a revision of an earlier edition or emasculation, in an “effort
to curry favor with the text-book patrons of both sections”;
also those histories with separate editions for North and
South, as well as those “written and published at the North
in which an honest effort is made to do justice to the South”
but which failed to emphasize the distinctive features of the
South or to emphasize the place of the South in the history
of the Union. The third group contained a list of text-books
acceptable to the Veterans, including <i>Hansell’s Histories</i>
by H. E. Chambers of Louisiana, <i>History of the American
People</i> by J. H. Shinn of Arkansas, <i>History of the
United States</i> by Alexander Stephens of Georgia, <i>History of
the United States</i> by George F. Holmes of Virginia, <i>History
of the United States</i> by Blackburn and McDonald of Maryland,
<i>Grammar School History</i> by L. A. Field of Georgia,
and <i>History of the United States</i> by J. T. Terry of Georgia.</p>

<p>The report of the Committee of 1894 was accepted unanimously
and the resolution, passed to continue the committee,
urged that it “do everything in its power to encourage the
preparation of suitable school histories and especially to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
encourage their publication by the building up of Southern
publishing houses....”<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p>

<p>The Reports of 1895 and of 1896 manifested the same
spirit and offered substantially the same recommendations
as those made by the Committee of 1894. Both desired a
“vindication for the Southern people and a refutation of
the slanders, the misrepresentations and the imputations”
which they had “so long and patiently borne.”<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The
Report of 1895 pointed out that “while the South has
always been prominent in making history, she has left the
writing of history to New England historians” whose chief
defect was “lack of catholic sympathy for all sections of
the country.”<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> The importance of the work of the Historical
Committee was recognized in 1895 by increasing its
membership from seven to fifteen to include a representative
from each Southern state.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p>By 1897 the agitation for sectional histories had become
so stormy that the Nashville reunion took under advisement
a suggestion of the Grand Army of the Republic of Wisconsin,
which proposed the appointment of a “commission of
distinguished educators from the ranks of the contending
armies” who should write a history of the period 1861 to
1865 which should be satisfactory to both sections.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Historical Committee of the Confederate Veterans, however,
deemed it inadvisable to undertake such a project, believing
that a history textbook could not be written as well by a
commission as by one person. However, the Committee
pointed out that “the destiny of the South is now inseparably
bound up with that of this great republic and that it
is to the interest of the whole nation and its citizens everywhere
that coming generations of Southern men should give
to the Union the same love and devotion which their fathers
gave to the United States and then to the ill-starred Confederacy;....”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
And, although they realized that “no
sectional history is wanted in the schools of this country,”
yet the Southern people desired in their histories “to retain
from the wreck in which their constitutional views, their
domestic institutions, the mass of their property, and the
lives of their best and bravest were lost, the knowledge that
their conduct was honorable throughout, and that their submission
at last ... in no way blackened their motives or
established the wrong of the cause for which they fought.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Among the points at issue in the adoption of Northern
textbooks was the use of certain opprobrious terms. At the
Atlanta reunion in 1898, a resolution was adopted which
gave voice to such objections. It requested the substitution
of the term “the civil war between the States” for “the
war of the Rebellion,” because such an expression reflected
“on the patriotism of the Southern people and the cause for
which they so heroically fought....”<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> The Historical
Committee at the same time indicated their aversion to
other “offensive epithets” in Northern histories, such as
“rebels” and “arch-traitors.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> They recommended,
among other things, that “Boards of Education and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
others having charge of the selection of histories, geographies,
speeches, readers, etc., be careful to exclude works
that show the partisan, sectional and unpatriotic spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Yet the need of a “broad American patriotism” was
recognized by the United Confederate Veterans regardless
of their attacks on Northern produced histories. Such an
attitude manifested itself in the committee report of the reunion
of 1898 which quoted with favorable comment an
extract from an address of Commander John W. Frazier of
the Fred Taylor Post, G. A. R., of Philadelphia. The Confederate
Veterans especially approved the spirit of Mr.
Frazier when he declared: “We must under the blending
influence exerted by the new order of things, undo that which
sectional feelings led both North and South to do in regard
to the publication of public school histories—certain to create
and foster lasting and bitter prejudices—and use our
influence in behalf of a public school history of the late war
and the causes leading to it, that will be used in common in
all the public schools of the country,....”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>The suggestion of Mr. Frazier reflected the welding influence
of the Spanish-American War upon all factions in
America. In 1899, the Historical Committee of the Confederate
Veterans announced that its duty was “little more
than to keep watch upon the histories of the day” for “the
prospect for fairness and candor in historical writing”
seemed “much improved since the Spanish War,” because
“a new perspective,” had been afforded the historian.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Yet
the same report evidenced a watchfulness on the part of the
Southerner to prevent the use of books which “either pervert
or fail to do justice to the history of the people of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
section.”<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The reunion further endorsed the recommendation
of the Historical Committee for the appointment in
each state of a sub-committee of three to examine “every
history taught in the schools of the state with especial reference
to ascertaining whether said books contain incorrect or
inaccurate statements or make important omissions of facts,
or inculcate narrow or partisan sentiments.”<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> In the event
that any defects were found in any of the histories used in
the schools, the Committee suggested that each sub-committee
should “enter into friendly correspondence with the
authors and publishers of such books, with a view to correcting
such errors, or supplying such omissions.” In addition,
it became the duty of each sub-committee “annually, one
month before each reunion to make a report” to the Historical
Committee, showing what histories of the state and
of the United States were used in the schools of the state;
and further “to make such suggestions with regard to school
histories and with regard to the teaching of history” as
might seem appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p>

<p>The reports of the next few years show a slackening
vigilance on the part of the historical committees. At each
meeting of the Veterans a report and suggestions as to the
improvement of historical instruction in the South were
offered, but much of the recriminatory tone of the reports of
the ’nineties had disappeared. In 1900, the Committee
recommended again that the term “the war between the
states” be substituted for other terms, and that money be
appropriated in order that the Historical Committee could
carry on their campaign, through the press and public
meetings, for the use of histories doing “full justice” both
to the South and the North.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The Reunion of 1902 sanctioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the suggestion of the Historical Committee dealing
with the preparation of a source book portraying the “character,
the ideals and the leadership of the South,” and called
favorable attention to Thomas Dixon’s novel <i>The Leopard’s
Spots</i>.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>The historical reports presented to the reunions held in
1908, 1909 and 1910 still discussed the need for “true history”
although commending the fairness of most historians.
Yet the Committee hesitated to relax its watchfulness because
“the history of the Confederate period as it is told in
many books that may be used in our schools, ... demands
and deserves undiminished vigilance.”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>The Report of 1910 expressed, however, a sanguine satisfaction
in the condition resulting from the agitation about
history textbooks. “We do not fear the bookmaker now,”
the Veterans declared. “Southern schools and Southern
teachers have prepared books which Southern children may
read without insult or traduction of their fathers. Printing
presses all over the Southland—and all over the Northland—are
sending forth by thousands ones which tell the true
character of the heroic struggle. The influence and wealth
of the South forbid longer the perversion of truth and the
falsification of history.”<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p>In the reports of the historical committees two history
textbooks received specific criticism for their treatment of
Southern institutions and life. In 1903, attention was called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
to a paragraph in <i>The Young People’s Story of the Great
Republic</i> by Ella Hines Stratton, in which “a most false
and misleading account” was given of the capture of Fort
Pillow by General N. B. Forrest.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> The Report of 1911
devoted considerable space to an attack on Elson’s <i>History
of the United States</i>. “One of the most extraordinary happenings
in regard to the history of the South occurred in
Virginia in the last few weeks,” chronicled the Report.
“Elson’s History of the United States had been selected as
a textbook by Roanoke College. Miss Sarah Moffett, one
of the students of the college, refused to attend the history
class or use this history where it referred to the South and
its people. For this she suffered reprimand.”<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The Southern
Cross Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy
thereupon undertook an investigation and issued
a circular which was “widely distributed.”<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> The circular
was addressed: “To the Daughters of the Confederacy, the
Camps of the Confederate Veterans, the Sons of Veterans,
and to all Who are Loyal to the Southland, and Love Her
Traditions and Desire a truthful History of Her Social and
Political Life.”<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>The charges brought against Mr. Elson rested upon “the
partisan spirit that prompted the writer to slander a people
who had reached the pinnacle of high ideals, refinement and
culture, and to which it has never been the fortune of many
to attain.”<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> To the Southerner was especially abhorrent
the portrayal of slave life in the South in which it was said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
“‘Often the attractive slave woman was a prostitute to her
master,’” “‘an evil’” that “‘was widespread at the
South.’”<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Further objections arose to the statement: “‘A
sister of President Madison declared that though the Southern
ladies were complimented with the name of wife they
were only the mistresses of Seraglios’”; and that “‘a leading
Southern lady declared to Harriet Martineau that the
wife of many a planter was but the chief slave of his
harem.’”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Mr. Elson was also regarded as misrepresenting
the cause of the Civil War, which he attributed “to
slavery and slavery alone” and not to state rights, which
he declared “in the abstract had nothing to do with bringing
on the war.”<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>In response to the circular of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, the Veterans adopted a resolution indicating
that it could not be “too earnestly pressed upon the attention
of those in charge of our educational institutions the supreme
importance of excluding from our schools and colleges
all histories that do not in their reports of the great struggle
for constitutional liberty ... fairly and impartially represent
the facts.” The Reunion further resolved that there be
used “only such histories as will recognize the justice of
that cause [of 1861-1865] in support of which so many of
our brave comrades shed their blood and gave their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>In 1912 the agitation regarding history textbooks had lost
much of its bitterness and the line of cleavage between the
Northerner’s history and that of the Southerner seemed less
apparent. Under the fusing influence of the World War,
the Confederate Veterans held their reunion in 1917 in the
city of Washington where Confederate and Union flags
waved together.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> But the spirit of sectional interest had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
too long enslaved them and, in 1921, the Reunion favorably
adopted a report of the Rutherford Committee. Chief
among the achievements for a “true history” which
the Committee were able to report was the adoption of
satisfactory histories in the states of Mississippi and
Texas. The Committee predicted similar action in North
Carolina where there were “true histories by Southern
authors and published by a home house,” thereby eliminating
any necessity for even considering “any Yankee
books.”<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>A revival of propaganda for sectional histories since 1921
is due in some degree to the appearance of two pamphlets
which set forth the need of a distinct type of history for
the South: <i>The Truth of the War Conspiracy of 1861</i>,
by H. W. Johnstone, and <i>Truths of History</i>, by Mildred
Lewis Rutherford, state historian for the United Daughters
of the Confederacy. These pamphlets received the unanimous
endorsement of the United Confederate Veterans at
their meeting in Richmond, Virginia, June, 1922, in a resolution
recommending their use in the public schools.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Among
other things, these writings purported to establish the fact
that Lincoln began the Civil War. The committee report declared:
“This [<i>The Truth of the War Conspiracy of 1861</i>]
presents the official evidence gathered principally from the
United States Government archives, which proves the Confederate
War was deliberately and personally conceived and
its inauguration made by Abraham Lincoln, and that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
personally responsible for forcing the war upon the
South.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The endorsement of this ultra-Southern viewpoint caused
a storm of protest, particularly in the North. Under the
caption “The Confederate Veterans’ New Glands,” the
<i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i> observed: “We are moved to wonder,
‘What is history?’ The Standard Dictionary defines
it as ‘a systematic record of past events.’ No better definition
in six words occurs to us. But more or less recent
events in world politics, coupled with the current action of
the Confederate Veterans, indicates [<i>sic</i>] that that definition
is in error. History is becoming, if it has not already
reached that stage, a medium of propaganda. That became
evident in the world war, when European histories were
combed for evidence of the innate barbarity of the German
people. It was more evident in the efforts to arouse the
American people to the point of intervention and actual warfare
to free Ireland. It is now emphasized through the
efforts of the Confederate Veterans to impose upon the
children of the south their own interpretation of the Civil
War, regardless of accuracy or the effect upon the nation.
The Veterans are attempting to pass on their old hates and
rancors to their descendants. They have not yet surrendered
to Grant. They are a trifle feeble, to be sure, but
apparently becoming less so. They are busily engaged in
swapping their old glands for new.”<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p><i>The New York Times</i> expressed equally strong disapproval
of an effort to revive the bitterness of the past and
attempt “a revocation of beatification or canonization” of
Lincoln.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>No less resentful at the attempted disparagement of Lincoln’s
services were the officers of the Grand Army of the
Republic, who assailed Miss Rutherford’s statement that
Lincoln began the war as a “lie.”<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Mrs. John A. Logan,
representing the Dames of the Loyal Legion, also offered objections
to such “a perversion of facts,” and declared that
all patriotic societies would be urged to seek the suppression
of any such histories.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>Protests against this revival of sectional animosity were
not localized in the North. <i>The Macon</i> [Georgia] <i>Telegraph</i>
suggested to Miss Rutherford that she would find
better employment were she to bring to public view the virtues,
the generosities and heroisms which were in the Old
South and should be carried over in the New South. The
<i>Telegraph</i> also believed that it would prove fruitful of good
were she to dwell on the cordial tributes paid by the North
to Lee as a man and as a general; and as for Lincoln, with
much less research than she used in unearthing dubious
evidences of his antagonism to the Southerners, she could
find almost innumerable and indubitable proofs of his good-will.
The <i>Telegraph</i> concluded that “the whole nation
looks upon its Lincolns and its Lees as Americans, and humanity
looks upon them as its own.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>Beside the allegation that Lincoln began the Civil War,
Miss Rutherford, following the impulse given her by the
Johnstone pamphlet, <i>Truths of the War Conspiracy of 1861</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span><a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
offered quotations to show that Lincoln was not a fit example
for children, nor was he given his rightful place in history.
Such quotations as the following are indicative of the character
of her remarks: “People found in Lincoln before his
death nothing remarkably good or great, but on the contrary,
found in him the reverse of goodness or greatness. Lincoln
as one of Fame’s immortals does not appear in the Lincoln
of 1861 (Schouler’s <i>History of the United States</i>, Vol. VI,
p. 21).”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> “Lincoln signed the liquor revenue bill and
turned the saloon loose on the country, thus undoing the
previous temperance work of the churches.”<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> “Mr. Lincoln
went to church, but he went to mock and came away to
mimic.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> “The people all drank, and Abe was for doing
what the people did, right or wrong.”<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> Miss Rutherford
also presented evidence designed to prove that Lincoln was
a tricky politician,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> and that the Emancipation Proclamation
was unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>In contrast with these characterizations of Lincoln are the
“spotless integrity, controlling conscience” and “sincere
religious convictions” ascribed to Davis. Even a Northern
historian, Ridpath, according to Miss Rutherford, testified
that Davis had bitterness toward no man.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>Eighty-one per cent of the schools and colleges in the
South, according to Miss Rutherford, were using, in 1921,
“text-books untrue to the South,” and “seventeen per cent”
were “using histories omitting most important facts concerning
the South.”<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> As written, the histories “magnify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and exalt the New England colonies and the Mayflower
crew, with bare mention of the Jamestown Colony, thirteen
years older, and the crews of the <i>Susan Constant</i>, the <i>Discovery</i>,
and the <i>Goodspeed</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Other objectionable features
in most school histories were the “extended account” generally
given to the “religious faith and practice” of New
England with no mention of Sir Thomas Dale’s Code in the
Jamestown Colony, “which enforced daily attendance upon
Divine worship, penalty for absence, penalty for blasphemy,
penalty for speaking evil of the Church, and refusing
to answer the Catechism, and for neglecting work.”<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Other Southerners than Miss Rutherford have criticized
the customary presentation of history. “We owe it to our
dead, to our living, and to our children, to preserve the truth
and repel the falsehoods, so that we may secure just judgment
from the only tribunal before which we may appear
and be fully and fairly heard, and that tribunal is the bar
of history,” asserted Benjamin H. Hill.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Likewise Thomas
Nelson Page declared: “In a few years there will be no
South to demand a history if we have history as it is now
written. How do we stand today in the eyes of the world?
We are esteemed ‘ignorant, illiterate, cruel, semi-barbarous,
a race sunken in brutality and vice, a race of slave drivers
who disrupted the Union in order to perpetuate human
slavery and who as a people have contributed nothing to the
advancement of mankind.’”<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Among the textbooks designated by Miss Rutherford for
special criticism were Davidson’s <i>History of the United
States</i>, Montgomery’s <i>Beginner’s American History</i>, and
Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> Davidson was criticized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
because he asserted that “the Jamestown colonists were
vicious idlers and jail birds picked up on the streets of London,”
and because of the statement that “side by side the
two civilizations had grown up in America—the one dedicated
to progress and kept up with the spirit of the age—the
other a landed aristocracy with slavery as the chief
excuse for its existence.”<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Condemnation was meted out to Muzzey’s textbook because
it was alleged that he said, “The cause for which the
Confederate soldiers fought was an unworthy cause and
should have been defeated,” and because “it is impossible
for the student of history today to feel otherwise than that
the cause for which the South fought was unworthy.”<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
Montgomery was placed in the objectionable group because
he described the settlers of Georgia as “filthy, ragged,
dirty prisoners taken from the ‘Debtor’s Prison’ by
Oglethorpe.”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, R. G. Horton’s <i>A Youth’s History of
the Civil War</i> presents a point of view acceptable to Miss
Rutherford, for it declares that “the withdrawal of the
Southern States from the Union was in no sense a declaration
of war upon the Federal government but the Federal
government declared war on them, as history will
show.”<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless the most prejudiced discussion of mooted questions
since the Civil War appears in the textbooks produced
before the opening of the twentieth century. This period,
in general, characterized by a spirit of intense local patriotism,
reflected itself clearly in the history textbooks. During
this period were published such Southern textbooks as Venable,
<i>A School History of the United States</i>, Lee, <i>New School<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
History of the United States</i>, Chambers, <i>A School History
of the United States</i>, and Taylor, <i>Model School History</i>.</p>

<p>Susan Pendleton Lee’s <i>New School History of the United
States</i> can be quoted as typical. “The Constitution of the
United States recognized slavery.... The opinion that
it was a moral wrong did not prevail before the days of
Garrison and his followers who pronounced it to be the sum
of all ‘iniquity.’... The outcry against slavery had made
the Southern people study the subject, and they had reached
the conclusion that the evils connected with it were less
than those of any other system of labor. Hundreds of
thousands of African savages had been Christianized under
its influence. The kindest relations existed between the
slaves and their owners.... The bondage in which the
negroes were held was not thought a wrong to them, because
they were better off than any other menial class in the
world.”<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> The same author justified the Ku Klux Klan
because “no high spirited, courageous people could patiently
submit to such a government.” “As open resistance was
impossible,” she declares, “they, too, had recourse to secret
organizations. They were at first local, and were intended
for self-protection against the barn burnings and worse
outrages committed by misguided negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>As a result of this desire to present the history of their
section in terms of their own convictions, the Southerners
have always agitated for textbooks different from those
used in Northern schools. Northern textbook companies
whose enterprise was much condemned during the <i>ante-bellum</i>
period have capitalized this sectional preference and
produced for Southern consumption, among others, Evans’
<i>The Essential Facts of American History</i>, Chambers’ A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
<i>School History of the United States</i>, and Stephenson’s <i>An
American History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> On the other hand, for the North, the
same book companies have published textbooks satisfactory
to that section. Today, in substantially all of the states
which formed the Confederacy, specific textbooks in American
history are prescribed, a practice not so universal in the
North, where local adoption is sometimes found.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> An analysis
of these Southern textbooks, however, discloses a very
temperate presentation of controversial questions. Upon the
points of contention between the North and the South, there
is a natural bias in favor of the South, a tendency to attempt
justification and exoneration. Evans, in <i>The Essential Facts
of American History</i>, for example, in discussing “reasons
for secession,” lays greater stress than the textbooks of the
North on the right of secession, a “right which had been
asserted by other than the Southern States.”<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Stephenson,
in <i>An American History</i>, dubs John Brown as “that terrible
John Brown,”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> and characterizes the carpet-bag governments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
as insolent, dishonest and violent.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> The terms “rebellion”
and “civil war” are employed by Northern, not
Southern, histories, the “war of the states” and the “war of
secession” being used in the South.</p>


<h4>ATTEMPTS OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC TO
CONTROL HISTORY TEXTBOOKS</h4>

<p>Six years before the Confederate Veterans in reunion accepted
the report of their first historical committee regarding
the “false” histories used in Southern schools, the Grand
Army of the Republic learned through a similar channel
that the history textbooks of the North “signally” failed
“to comprehend the causes that resulted in the war of the
rebellion.”<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Much cause for complaint arose from the fact
that textbooks were “compiled for a national system of
education, South as well as North,”—a condition held sadly
unacceptable, it would seem, by the patriotic organizations
of this period.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>In the Report of 1888, the G. A. R. undertook to point
out statements in textbooks used in the South which appealed
to them as indicative of “a thoroughly studied, rank,
partisan system of sectional education.”<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> As a case in
point Davidson’s <i>School History of South Carolina</i>, “published
at Columbia, South Carolina, by one W. J. Duffie,
copyrighted in 1869,” was examined. This history, so the
Report declared, in Chapter 195 ascribed “the cause of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
secession, which was the cause of the war,” to the fact that
“Congress kept passing laws which it had no right to pass
according to the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Further, in speaking of
the withdrawal of South Carolina from the Union the author
asserted that “she had a right to do this; that is, if the
States rights party of the South was correct in its
doctrine.”<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The Report condemned another history textbook, written
by Blackburn and McDonald, because of the following passage:
“The second year of the war now commenced; it
found each section preparing with terrible earnestness for
the conflict. The South was straining every nerve to resist
the Northern multitudes; ... To fill her armies the
North had a better and more successful mode, she offered
immense bounties and high pay. Induced by these, thousands
of European mercenaries enlisted. The South had
nothing but her gallant children to put in the field and thus
she was condemned to stake her most precious jewels against
the trash of Europe.”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Other grounds for criticism were found in Alexander
Stephens’ common school history which was guilty of an
effort “to indoctrinate the youth” of the South with the
“monstrous heresy” of state rights and secession.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>“These Southern histories do not fail to make known
their side of this question. They are full of it,” concluded
the Committee. “What we deem treason is there made
respectable. While our histories on the same subject are
comparatively silent, indeed are so lamentably deficient upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
this question that it were far better to discard all history of
our country during the epoch of 1860-5 than to admit them
to our schools as now compiled. It is indeed time to cease
toying with treason for policy, and to cease illustrating
rebels as heroes, as in the case of some of our school
histories.”<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>The Report of 1888 inaugurated a practice extending over
a period of more than twenty years. The Report of 1892
laid its emphasis upon the fact that the textbooks in history
“slandered the North and the cause of the Union, ... depreciated
the value of our troops, and represented that the
South was in the right, and that the army which saved the
Union was a wicked aggressor....”<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>In 1895 the Encampment, meeting at Louisville, had its
attention called by the Department of Indiana to the character
of history textbooks used in Northern schools. In that
state alarm had been excited by Montgomery’s <i>Leading
Facts of American History</i>, “the authorized history” for
the public schools of the state. Under the auspices of the
local G. A. R. an investigation of this book had been conducted.
As a result, seven charges were presented against
it, the indictment stating that Ellis’ <i>Eclectic Primary History</i>
and Barnes’ <i>History</i> were believed to be “equally
objectionable.”<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>The objections of the Indiana G. A. R. received the endorsement
of the national encampment, and Montgomery’s
history was found guilty on the following counts: first, it
contained “no suggestion or intimation that the men who
fought for the preservation of the Union were right”; second,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
there was “a general unfairness of treatment of the
people of the North, of the officers and soldiers of the Union
armies and the battles fought by them”; third, it was
“calculated to give the student false impressions as to the
relative courage, heroism and achievements of the contending
armies, and of the endurance, devotion and sacrifices of
the people of the two sections of the country engaged in the
conflict”; fourth, “the accounts of the victories of the
Confederates” were “exaggerated, while those of the Union
armies” were “dwarfed and made insignificant by comparison”;
in the fifth place, “all statements of a commendatory
and eulogistic character” were “reserved for
the Confederates, while nothing of like character” was said
“in favor of the Union soldiers or people”; sixth, that it
was “unpatriotic and partisan in statement, tone and sentiment”;
and seventh, that it was “unreliable in its statement
of facts.”<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<p>Among objectionable history textbooks “written by
Southern authors, for the avowed purpose of giving a history
of the War of the Rebellion from a Southern standpoint,”
was that of “Reverend Dr. D. W. Jones, published in
1896.”<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> This book was taken “as a fair sample of its
class” by the Committee on School Histories reporting in
1897. The Veterans rested their case upon such a statement
as: “The seceding states not only had a perfect right to
withdraw from the Union but they had amply sufficient
cause for doing so.”<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>In the “careful examination” to which the school histories
of the North were subjected by the Committee of 1897
no book was found which deserved “unqualified endorsement.”<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
This was due to the “one vital defect” common
to all the histories—that all of them treated the War “as
a contest between the sections of the country ... and not
as a war waged by the Government for the suppression of
rebellion against National authority and meant to destroy
National existence.”<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Indeed, the Committee had reached
their conclusions regarding the “histories in general use in
all sections” after “two days of examination.”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> During
this time they had found in “many of these works extravagant
expressions as ‘this crushing defeat’” in speaking of
the Northern army, and such a statement as “‘the Confederates
could not be conquered until they were destroyed,’”—all
equally obnoxious and uncomplimentary to
the North.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Such a condition, the Committee felt, arose
from “a commercial spirit” which “largely controls and
inspires these publications.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>In view of the situation as it then existed, the Committee
asked that the “Encampment record a solemn and emphatic
protest against the further use of any history of the Civil
War in the public schools of this country which does not
teach that this war was a war waged by the National Government
for the suppression of rebellion and the preservation
of National existence; that there was a right side and
a wrong side, ... that in the decision of this question the
victors were right and the vanquished wrong.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> They
further recommended that the agitation for “improved
text-books” be continued, that a permanent committee on
the teaching of patriotism in the schools be appointed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
that the Grand Army of the Republic and its allied organizations
“give direct and persistent attention to the removal
and exclusion of improper histories ... in use.”<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>The results of the agitation for “unbiased” histories
which the Confederate Veterans felt had been achieved by
1896 in the South, the G. A. R. through their activities
failed to accomplish in the North before 1898. However,
at that time they felt “justified to report substantial improvement
in the tone and sentiment” of textbooks, particularly
in “the more recent publications.”<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Yet they urged
“a continuance of effort ... to place before the children of
the Republic truthful and patriotic histories” of the Civil
War, and registered a “solemn and emphatic protest”
against the proposal that the struggle of 1861 to 1865 be
called “the Civil War between the States.”<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The following year the Committee report rang with a
spirit of optimism because of the changed character of history
writing and instruction brought about by “our organization.”
As proof for their gratification they pointed
out that “in one of the leading works in use more than fifty
substantial changes of the text have been made in that portion
presenting the history of the rebellion.”<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Yet regret
was expressed that no history known to them made “it clear
in statement that the war for the preservation of the Union
was prosecuted on the one side by the National Government
and on the other by those in armed rebellion against its
authority.”<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> To insure continued vigilance the Encampment
approved the appointment of an “aide” to each department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
to keep in touch with the school histories in his
state, and to “confer with school authorities and endeavor
through them to secure the best obtainable school histories
in the schools and the exclusion of such as are unfit.”<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>The satisfaction expressed by the Committee of 1900 was
reiterated at the encampment the following year. But the
Committee were robbed of much of their gratification when
they considered the “avowedly sectional standpoint” of
histories in the South, where it was still taught that the
Confederate States were “a lawful government.”<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>The agitation to investigate history textbooks lost much
of its vigor and aggressive anxiety with the opening of the
twentieth century. In 1904 the chairman of the school
history committee suggested “in view of the utter want of
interest exhibited throughout the whole country in regard
to this matter” that the committee “be abolished.”<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
Warren Lee Goss, national patriotic instructor, reporting at
the forty-first encampment in 1907 declared it his belief
that the G. A. R. were “not called upon to interfere in any
way with the regular instruction in the schools in United
States history, but rather to supplement that instruction by
special observances.”<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> Two years later the portion of the
report on patriotic instruction devoted to “histories” merely
listed the textbooks most commonly used,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> and in 1910 a
similar report eulogized “the loyalty and patriotism of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
majority [of those living] who wore the gray.”<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> This
sympathetic and tolerant attitude seems to have remained
unchallenged in the successive encampments of the G. A. R.,
and unlike the Confederate Veterans of the last few reunions,
the Grand Army of the Republic have not sought to
rekindle old animosities.</p>


<h4>TEXTBOOKS FOR ROMAN CATHOLICS</h4>

<p>As early as 1834 the Roman Catholics of New York urged
upon the schools textbooks which would show agreement with
their point of view. In 1828 the Public School Society, an
organization designed to educate poor children not provided
for by any religious society, was allowed to levy a local tax
for its support. To this the Roman Catholics raised objections,
since they were permitted to dictate neither the kind
of instruction offered nor the textbooks adopted. Among the
points in controversy was the request of the Catholic clergy
that no book should be used but such as had been submitted
to the Bishop and declared “free from sectarian principles
or calumnies against his religion.”<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> In those books where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
objectionable statements were found, it was suggested “that
such passages be expunged or left out in binding.”<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> The
censorship requested was not granted, and in 1840 the agitation
regarding textbooks was renewed. Again it was
charged that some books contained passages not merely displeasing
to the Roman Catholics, but hostile to their faith;
whereas others indulged in statements which were both
“defamatory” and “false.”</p>

<p>The trustees of the Public School Society, avowedly
anxious to dissipate these objections, took measures to secure
information from various sources, including both laymen
and clergy, with the hope that a removal of the
complaint might be effected. They adopted a resolution
declaring that they would submit for examination, to the
Reverend Felix Varela, some textbooks used in Public School
Number 5. As further proof of their desire for harmony, the
trustees appointed a committee of five to see whether the
books in the schools or libraries contained passages derogatory
to the Roman Catholics.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Following their action Reverend
Mr. Varela pointed out certain objectionable features
in some of the textbooks. In one geography he discovered
a passage in which the Catholic clergy were characterized as
having great influence but being opposed to the diffusion of
knowledge. He also disapproved of the description of Italy
in which were statements which would “tend to diminish
the consideration that a Catholic child has for the Catholic
Church.”<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> In another textbook, the discussion of the
character of Luther proved objectionable, for, although it
might please the Protestants, he felt that there was implied
an attack on the Catholic Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>On July 9, 1840, John Power, vice-general of the diocese
of New York, wrote a letter to the editor of <i>Freeman’s Journal</i>,
in which he voiced his disapproval of the textbooks
employed to instruct children. Odium, he felt, was attached
to the Catholic clergy because they were represented as
keeping the people in ignorance to promote their own interests,
and libraries contained books with “most malevolent
and foul attacks on their religion ... no doubt with the
very laudable purpose of teaching them [Catholic children]
to abhor and despise that monster called popery.”<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>With failure attending their efforts at censorship, the
Roman Catholics resorted to an address to their “fellow
citizens of the city and state of New York” in which they
appealed for a redress of their grievances. “We are Americans
and American citizens. If some of us are foreigners,”
they declared, “it is only by the accident of birth,....
But our children, for whose rights as well as our own we
contend in this matter, are Americans by nativity.”<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Repeating
the assertions of the priests, the address remonstrated
against the false “historical statements respecting
the men and things of past times, calculated to fill the minds
of our children with errors of fact and at the same time to
excite in them prejudice against the religion of their parents
and guardians.”<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>In answer to the exceptions raised by the Catholics, the
trustees of the Public School Society expressed doubt as to
the wisdom of expurgation, for they believed “nothing of a
mere negative character” would be acceptable. “The
books selected for the children,” they stated, “have, from
the first, been those used and most highly esteemed as
school-books. The passages objected to, or nearly all of
them, are historical, and relate to what is generally called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
the Reformation. The writers were Protestants, and took
a view of the men and incidents of that excited and eventful
period directly opposed to those entertained by the members
of the Roman Catholic Church. These portions, must,
of course, be offensive to Catholics, and they furnish just
cause for complaint.... The objectionable passages are
not numerous, but the books are not to be found without
them.... The difficulty of procuring books entirely exempt
from objection cannot perhaps be more forcibly illustrated
than by the fact that one work containing passages
as liable to objection as almost any other, is now used as a
class-book even in the Catholic schools. It is the intention
of the trustees, nevertheless, to prosecute the work of expurgation
until every just cause of complaint is removed.”<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>As a result of the agitation, revised and expurgated books
appeared; in some instances the objectionable passages were
stamped out with ink from a wooden block or the leaves
pasted together or removed. In some cases the books under
criticism were prohibited in the libraries and the schools.
Yet this failed to satisfy the Roman Catholics. When the
expurgated editions were worn out, they were replaced by
new books without changes, and gradually this discussion
over textbooks subsided.</p>

<p>During the ’eighties it again became a matter of speculation
with the Roman Catholics whether they should be
taxed to support schools from which their children got “no
benefit,” or, if attending, suffered “positive injury and injustice.”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>
They were indeed skeptical as to the merits
of a non-sectarian education which they held “professedly
non-Christian,”—a system that occupied itself “as little
with the mission, history, and teachings of the divine Founder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
of Christianity” as it did “with the life and doctrines of
Confucius or Buddha.”<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>A storm center of the agitation was Boston, where the
Catholics formed a considerable number of the population.
Here a denunciation of public school instruction included
both teachers and textbooks, resulting in the removal of
Swinton’s <i>History</i> and the dismissal of a teacher (a Mr.
Travis) for “erroneous and misleading” statements about
the granting of indulgences.</p>

<p>“It is very hard,” declared one writer on the controversy,
“that a young man who teaches only what he has been
taught himself, only what thousands of young men and
women have been taught and are teaching, should be singled
out and set aside for penalty while others go scot free....
While the Roman Catholics were weak they could not help
themselves, and we went on saying what we pleased. Now
they are numerous enough in some places to hold the balance
of power, and they hold it with a mighty grasp....”<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>In an effort to prevent the exclusion of the textbook from
the schools, the Protestants advanced various arguments:
that it had been in use ten years without protest, that “the
outcry” was not “honest,” and that the agitation was
“simply the opening wedge for riving our school system
and dividing the public school money between Catholics and
Protestants.”<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>Other histories than Swinton’s were in like manner placed
by the Catholics in the objectionable list. It was alleged
that Prescott’s works “swarm[ed] with Puritan prejudice
against all things Catholic” and that Macaulay’s <i>History of
England</i> emphasized the worst traits of Catholic personages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
and gave little credit to the Jesuits.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> So far as Macaulay
was concerned, one Catholic objected to sending his children
to school to study history from a book acknowledged by the
Protestants to be “a gloriously Protestant book,” by which
his children would be “gloriously indoctrinated into Protestantism
and a hatred of their parents’ religion.”<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>As a means of settling the controversy it was suggested
that all history or the parts relating to the Protestant and
Catholic churches be omitted from the curriculum. This
could be done, one writer maintained, “without missing anything
of value to our common school system or to our other
cherished institutions.” Moreover, it was also held that
there were “plenty of undisputed topics” to be studied in
the schools which were looked upon with “entire unanimity”
by “all creeds,” such as two and two make four.
For “nothing should ever be taught in schools supported by
common funds except that which is accepted by the common
faith.”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>With the great expansion of the Catholic Church in the
United States since the Civil War and the growth of parochial
schools in all parts of the country, the particular
needs of the Catholics have been met by the enterprise of
publishers in supplying special textbooks for their use.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
As a result today there are found in parochial schools such
social study textbooks as McCarthy’s <i>History of the United
States</i>, O’Hara’s <i>A History of the United States</i>, <i>A History
of the United States for Catholic Schools</i> by the Franciscan
Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration of St. Rose Convent, La<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Crosse, Wisconsin, Lawler’s <i>Essentials of American History</i>,
Betten’s <i>The Ancient World</i>, Betten and Kaufman’s <i>The
Modern World</i>, and Burke’s <i>Political Economy</i>.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>The desire to present events in American history in such
a way as to show the importance of the Catholic Church has
led to the preparation of textbooks like McCarthy’s <i>History
of the United States.</i> In this book it has been “made clear
that Catholics discovered, and in a large way, explored these
continents, that Catholics transferred civilization hither, that
they opened to the commerce of Europe the trade of the
Pacific, and that they undertook the conversion of multitudes
of dusky natives, of whom few had risen to the upper
stages of barbarism.”<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Although the “war for independence”
was begun largely by Protestants, the author avers
the help of Catholic nations like France and Spain gave “undoubted
assistance to the New Republic.” Norse settlement
and discovery are treated extensively, and Columbus’
missionary spirit receives considerable attention. Catholic
notables like Governor Dongan, the Calverts, Captain John
Barry, and Thomas Macdonough are given more space than
ordinarily allotted in school histories. “The winning of the
West, in which Catholics acted an important part,” the war
on the sea in which are enumerated “the exploits of the
O’Briens of Machias, Maine,” “the beginnings of the Catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Church in America” and “Washington’s patriotic letter
to his Catholic countrymen” are other unique features.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>Similar in point of view is the textbook written by the
Franciscan Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration. Its contents,
announces the <i>Foreword</i>, are not immured within the bounds
of “the usually taught historical facts,” but include “the
too often forgotten efforts of the Church in American History.”
Not only is the story of “the venturesome explorer,
the intrepid colonizer, the hardy pioneer, the noble warrior,
the eloquent statesman” narrated, but there is also depicted
“the quiet heroism of the loyal sons and daughters of the
Catholic Church.” “Our country is justly proud of the
liberty she offers to all her children,” affirm the authors,
“but these children are many in faith, and diversified in
race peculiarities. Common interests may seem to unite
them from time to time, but there can be no true, permanent
union except where the spirit and the faith are dominating
forces. But where is such a bond of unity except in the
Catholic Church? Mother Church folds her arms about all
her children and questions not their color or their race.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>To the teachers, the authors offer certain aids and directions.
The importance of a “proper setting of United
States history with a knowledge of the threefold chronological
divisions of world history” and an insight into the “difference
between Sacred history and Profane, or Secular
history” are indicated. In the period of colonization, teachers
are urged to make clear, among other things, “how the
Catholic Church, like the mustard seed of the Gospel, has
flourished and grown, as it were, into a mighty tree.” The
Sisters urge, also, a thorough delineation of the growth of
the educational system of the United States including an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
understanding of “how our cherished parochial schools grew
from humble beginnings into the splendid system which now
labors so zealously for the spiritual and intellectual welfare
of our country.”<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>The Betten-Kaufman histories, <i>The Ancient World</i> and
<i>The Modern World</i>, are typical of Roman Catholic textbooks
in the field of European history. Based upon West’s
<i>Ancient World</i> and his <i>Modern World</i>, the authors have
introduced changes desirable for the purpose of “promoting
the great cause of Catholic education.”<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> The chief departure
from the traditional European history textbook used
in the public schools is in the discussion of Luther and the
Reformation. Although Tetzel’s use of the theory of indulgences
is criticized in the Betten and Kaufman textbook
as “ill advised,”<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> Luther’s theories regarding the remission
of sins are characterized as “monstrous.”<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> The Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
as an agency for good and for promoting the civilization of
the world is given significant attention; the “Catholic view”
of social evils is set forth in opposition to other theories, and
a discussion of “harmonious coöperation” between church
and state is intended to disclose the influence of the Church
in the solution of the world’s evils.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>In an allied field Father Burke has written his <i>Political
Economy designed for use in Catholic Colleges, High
Schools, and Academies</i>. Here political economy is discussed
not only from the standpoint of “the merely concrete,
material things that enter into the science, but also
with reference to the personalities of the members of society
whose activity is exercised on these concrete, material
things.”<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Father Burke’s book is divided into twenty-three chapters
with titles common to the usual economics textbook. Its
unique feature lies in the treatment of various economic
theories from the point of view of the “Catholic School.”
The doctrine of Malthus is rejected for moral and economic
reasons, which take their course in “human injustice and
selfishness in the spirit of greed that closes the hearts of men
to the dictates of charity and fairness,” and which lead to
“improper methods of the distribution of wealth.”<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The
author expresses a belief in the inequality of man, through
which comes inequality of distribution. Such a hardship is
due, in no small degree, Father Burke declares, to the “fallen
state” of man. Because of the sin of his first parents he is
“subject to death, to sufferings, to misery, and to labor.”
This can be proved, it is averred, by the Book of Revelation.
“Hence,” asserts Father Burke, “evils may exist in
this world, injustice and oppression may go on, and the
equilibration of things may never take place here; the
wicked may prosper and the honest and just may be oppressed,
and no adequate remedy may appear; yet the
moment of compensation, of perfect justice, will come, if not
in this life, then in the life of eternity.”<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>Such a presentation of economic theories has been acclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
highly satisfactory in Catholic reviews, for, “since
ethics as a science directing human actions according to
right reason embraces of necessity all of man’s activities, it
follows that political economy is rightly subject to the laws
of ethics.”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> “This clear understanding of the state of
the question ... enables us at once to detect the errors and
dangers of many of the high sounding economic theories
which occupy so much space in the literature of the day,”
declares one reviewer.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Another reviewer in <i>Extension</i> believes
that an accurate knowledge of economic principles is
impossible “from an examination of the text-books used
in some of the secular colleges and universities” in which
not only are “some of the so-called principles false, but
the resultant deductions, where they are not entirely fallacious,
are frequently misleading.”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> <i>The Pilot</i> offers
its endorsement of the textbook because “in these days of
industrial and economic unrest, when so much that is false
and misleading is written on political and social problems, a
book on political economy for Catholic schools is most welcome.
Catholic philosophy sets forth sound and unimpeachable
principles bearing upon the rights of the individual and
of the family, and upon the powers and functions of ‘the
State.’”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of these books is to place emphasis upon
Catholic contributions and the power of the Church. As
indicated in a textbook written in the later nineteenth century,
whose content is much the same as the more recent
Catholic textbooks, it is “the manifest duty of those who
are entrusted with the education of our children to see that
in learning the history of the country they do not lose sight
of the rise, progress, and social influences of the Church in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the United States....<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> And finally, as religion is always
the sweetest inspiration and support of patriotism, the
breaking down of religious beliefs in various modern nations,
and notably in our own, is accompanied by a loss of patriotism....
Reverence for authority is lost, and society, in
order to protect itself, is driven to appeal to force. Nothing
can avert the danger but the influence of a great moral
power endorsed with all the attributes which create respect
and encourage obedience. The Catholic Church is this
power....”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>In turn, these textbooks have been criticised because of
the amount of space given to the Catholic Church in comparison
with that allotted other churches. One critic has
asserted that the history by the Franciscan Sisters does not
mention a single Protestant body after the period of the
Revolution, and that “one ignorant of the true situation
and reading this particular history would imagine that the
United States was a Catholic nation.”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Further criticism
has arisen because, in the critic’s mind, facts of history are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
mixed with “acts of Catholic piety.” As proof of this objection
is cited an excerpt from a Catholic textbook in which
is given a description of the death of Pizarro: “Just before
he died he called upon his Redeemer and tracing with his
bloody finger a cross upon the floor, he kissed the sacred
symbol and expired.”<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of this is seen by the same writer in the
statement that “as the missionaries made their way westward,
the worship of St. Mary marked their path till the
great Mississippi, the River of the Immaculate Conception,
bore them [down] toward those Spanish realms where every
officer swore to defend the Immaculate Conception.”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> To
this objector of a separate history for Catholic schools, “it
is the very evident purpose of these texts ... to propagate
Catholic ideas and not to give a true picture of the development
of America.”<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>


<h4>TEXTBOOKS IN CIVICS, ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY</h4>

<p>Criticism of public school textbooks and teaching is not
confined solely to the subject of history but includes in its
ever-widening circle books in the allied fields of civics,
economics and sociology. Especially is this true of those in
government or civics. Since the close of the World War a
movement for the teaching of the Constitution has closely
paralleled that for the study of American history. Organizations
and individuals with the avowed purpose of inculcating
patriotism have urged that more attention than formerly be
given the study of the machinery of government. To this
end influence has been exerted for the passage of laws requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the subject of civics in the schools, and many books
on the Constitution have appeared to meet an increased
demand.</p>

<p>Among the organizations which have sponsored the movement
for instruction in the Constitution have been the
American Bar Association, the National Security League,
The Constitution Anniversary Association, and the Better
America Federation. Organizations such as the Sentinels
of the Republic are engaged in a similar program in adult
education.</p>

<p>In 1922 in pursuance of a resolution adopted by the executive
committee at Tampa, Florida, the American Bar Association
appointed a Committee on American Citizenship
“to devise ways for promoting the study of and devotion to
American institutions and ideals.” This resolution was
interpreted as laying upon the Committee “the duty to prepare
a program under which the lawyers of the United
States, coöperating with every patriotic society and organization,
and with every true American man and woman, shall
be urged to join in an earnest effort to stem the tide of radical,
and often treasonable, attacks upon our Constitution,
our laws, our courts, our law-making bodies, our executives
and our flag, to arouse to action our dormant citizenship,
to abolish ignorance, and crush falsehood, and to bring truth
into the hearts of our citizenship.”<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>The Committee recommended the appointment of a standing
committee on American Citizenship, the appointment of
local committees “to see that the Constitution of the United
States is taught in every school ... to report to the bureau
the courses in each state, the textbooks used, and the qualifications
of teachers for teaching American citizenship.” In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
addition it was suggested that the coöperation of Commissioners
on Uniform State Laws be enlisted “in an effort to
have enacted in each state suitable laws making a course
each year in the study of and devotion to American institutions
and ideals part of the curriculum in all schools and
colleges sustained or in any manner supported by public
funds.”<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>The Reports of 1923 and 1924 again envisaged “the need
of activity” because of “the socialistic doctrines ...
taught in many of our schools and colleges,” and pointed out
that efforts of the Bar toward laws requiring the teaching of
the Constitution had received encouragement from legislators
and the public in general.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> In 1923, according to the
Report of that year, twenty-four states had definite laws,
in five states laws had been introduced and in nineteen states
there was no such statute. The principal difficulty which
the Committee had encountered in having such a law passed
had arisen out of “the conservatism of school authorities,”
who appeared “fearful that the mere requirement” would
“not necessarily be the best means of promoting the teaching
of the Constitution,” and who were “slow to change from
long established methods that had been used in connection
with the school curriculum.”</p>

<p>In their advocacy for a wider-spread knowledge of the
Constitution the American Bar Association received the
coöperation of other organizations interested in the same
work, such as the American Legion, patriotic societies,
women’s organizations, the Masonic Service Association,
the Knights of Columbus, Chambers of Commerce, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Rotary, Lions, and Kiwanis. Yet they felt that “the most
powerful influence” that they could evoke “undoubtedly
would be the association of teachers,” for they wished “to
reach the mind of the child while it is still plastic.” They
affirmed as their “ultimate aim” that “no child should
leave even the common schools without an elementary
knowledge and appreciation of our Constitution and what it
means to every individual.”<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>By 1924, the Committee reported the existence of a law
requiring the teaching of the Constitution in thirty-one
states, and in other commonwealths regulations of the state
department of education effecting the same purpose.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> One
of the aspects of the situation which appeared to the Committee
as more important even than properly qualified
teachers was “the proper attitude toward our government
and the spirit in which the teaching is performed”—a
teaching which should be grounded “on bed-rock Americanism”
and “imbued with a desire to communicate such spirit
to their pupils.”<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> Indeed, it was held that “the schools
of America should no more consider graduating a student
who lacks faith in our government than a school of theology
should graduate a minister who lacks faith in God.”<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>According to the Report the educational activities of the
Committee were many, “even going so far as to suggest to
the ministers appropriate texts for Thanksgiving Day which
should call attention to the blessing of our form of government.”<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
Members of the Bar had written special articles
for several periodicals on good citizenship as well as furnishing
cartoons for the press of the country. The Committee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
had aided in the display and sale of books on the Constitution,
they had sponsored “a nation-wide celebration of Constitution
week,” they had appeared as speakers on community
programs and otherwise had helped in the celebration of
national holidays. In addition they had prepared a “citizenship
creed.” This creed stressed the obligations of
citizenship and a faith in the American government, “the
best government that has ever been created—the freest
and most just for all the people.” To uphold and defend the
government was at all times a duty of the citizen. “Just as
the ‘Minute Man of the Revolution’ was ready upon a moment’s
notice to defend his rights against foreign usurpation”
so it was the citizen’s duty “as a patriotic American
to be a ‘Minute Man of the Constitution’ ready at all times
to defend the long-established and cherished institutions of
our government against attack, either from within or with
out,” and to do his “part in preserving the blessings of
liberty” for which his “Revolutionary forefathers fought
and died.”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>The National Security League is likewise engaged in the
movement for teaching the Constitution in the schools.
Through the Committee on Constitution Instruction and its
Civic Department, the League has campaigned “for over
three years” to have passed a bill requiring definite courses
in the Constitution in all public schools.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> According to
literature circulated by the League, the Committee was rewarded
by the passage of such a requirement in thirty-six
states, in most cases the legislatures taking over verbatim
the bill drafted by them.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>To the League’s program opposition to a mandatory legislative
control of education occasionally arose from educational
authorities in states where the bill had been introduced.
But the chairman of the Committee was “glad to
say that state legislators generally, representatives of the
public will, have not agreed with these gentlemen and their
arguments, and have looked upon a knowledge of the Constitution
as an essential in citizen making.”<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p>In addition to legislation which requires the study of the
Constitution, thirty-three states by May, 1925, made mandatory
a teacher’s examination on the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> So far-reaching
were the results of their activities, that the League’s
Committee on Constitutional Instruction estimated that
200,500 teachers were required to teach the Constitution of
the United States to a total of over 4,000,000 school
children.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>To find suitable textbooks became a problem, for the
Committee held that “while there are many books which
satisfactorily explain the Constitution to advanced students
and adults, there is practically nothing which suitably transmits
the basic principles of our government to the minds of
children.” For this “short stories” on the Constitution
were necessary in order that facts concerning the history
of the document would be “readily understood by the average
child,” because when “eloquently taught and interpreted
in story form by a teacher who knows it and reverences its
provisions, it will rouse any class to enthusiasm.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>Besides the “nation-wide popularization of the Constitution”
through the distribution of almost a million copies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
a “Catechism of the Constitution,” the National Security
League endeavors to assist teachers in passing their examinations
for licenses by publishing a Course on the Constitution
for Normal Schools.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Its literature on the Constitution has
been sent by request to 2038 teachers, to whom was also
made available Dr. Jean Broadhurst’s book, <i>Verse for
Patriots to Encourage Good Citizenship</i>, “of special value
in teaching English literature and patriotism” and for holiday
program materials.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> In the campaign for education,
Beck’s <i>The Constitution of the United States: Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow</i> was also sent “to the governors of all
the States where the bill requiring the compulsory teaching
of the Constitution has become a law, ... with the advice
that the book is available for all teachers and instructors in
their states upon application.”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> A teachers’ manual
“which is attracting wide attention under the title ‘Our
Constitution in My Town and My Life’ which contains 115
questions and answers on the Constitution for classroom
use” has been written by Miss Etta V. Leighton, Civic
Secretary.<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>As an “evidence of the value” and of the influence of the
Security League’s educational program, the “Report” for
November 15, 1925, recounted “that the Professor of Political
Science in a large western university will use our suggestions
in revising her text book on the State and National
Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

<p>The Constitution Anniversary Association, incorporated
March, 1923, is another organization engaged in promoting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
a study of the Constitution in order to familiarize to a
greater degree the people of this generation with “those historic
days incident to the writing of the Constitution,” that
they may “recognize their value” and understand “the
danger of our drifting during recent years away from representative
government toward direct action; from individual
property rights to socialism; from individual responsibility
for individual conduct toward class consciousness, class agitation
and class legislation,....” A purpose of the Association
is “to arouse interest in the men who wrote the
Constitution ... to make clear that they were governmentally-minded
as Edison and Marconi are electrically-minded;
as Emerson and Socrates were philosophically-minded; as
Shakespeare and Longfellow were literary-minded; as
Mozart and Mendelssohn were musically-minded; and that
in the light of all that history and experience could teach,
they were making a contribution as important to the science
of government as was [<i>sic</i>] the ten digits to the science of
mathematics, the scale to music, or the alphabet to language.”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
A further aim of the organization is “to urge
upon educational institutions that in the teaching of History,
Civics and Political Science the Constitution be given the
place of prominence and importance which it deserves.”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
The observance of Constitution Week, as the name of the
Association attests, is of primary interest to the organization.</p>

<p>Harry F. Atwood, author of <i>Back to the Republic</i>, <i>Safeguarding
American Ideals</i> and <i>Keep God in American History</i>,
directs the activities of the Constitution Anniversary
Association. Since 1918 Mr. Atwood “has spoken in all
parts of the country to various types of audiences on the
Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> While addressing a Los Angeles gathering
under the auspices of the Better America Federation in May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
1922, Mr. Atwood sowed the seed for the National Oratorical
Contest on the Constitution. It was at this meeting that
Mr. Harry Chandler, of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, conceived
the idea “of developing interest in the Constitution” by
conducting such a contest in the schools of the state. As
a result, “the school year of 1922-23 witnessed the preparation
of over 8000 orations,” and “the final contest was held
in Los Angeles where prizes aggregating $5000 were
awarded.”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> This led to similar contests in other states,
supported by “the American Bar Association, the Constitution
Anniversary Association and other patriotic organizations.”<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
The contest became nation-wide, the final
meeting being held at Washington. In the second contest
(1924-1925) over 18,000 schools entered; the awards
amounted to $45,600, and 1,500,000 high school students
competed. Twenty-eight daily newspapers across the continent
conducted this contest.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Atwood carries his advocacy of a knowledge of the
Constitution and of representative government to the people
not only through his addresses delivered throughout the
country but also by means of his writings. It is his belief
that “we have drifted from the <i>republic</i> toward democracy;
from statesmanship to demagogism” in “an age of retrogressive
tendencies.”<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> He holds that a republic provides
the “golden mean” of government, autocracy and democracy
offering “undesirable extremes.” To make clear his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
meaning parallels are drawn between “the realm of nature
and of human activity” and the realm of government, attributing
to each “two extremes and the golden mean.” For
instance, he believes that “what thirst is to the individual,
autocracy is to government; what drunkenness is to the
individual, democracy is to government; what temperance
is to the individual, the <i>republic</i> is to government.”<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>According to Mr. Atwood “the most defective portion of
our thinking and teaching in the schools is that phase of
education which pertains to civics, economics and history.”<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
So far as textbooks are concerned, Mr. Atwood
was convinced that “there are comparatively few who will
contend that there has ever been written a good history of
the United States of America.” The same statement holds
true for textbooks in civil government, for none makes clear
“to the average student the form of government that was
established here under the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Mr. Atwood
was concerned still more with the fact that so few students
had read the Constitution,—students who had received
from twelve to sixteen years’ education at the expense of the
state. “So long as the expense of the public schools and
State universities is paid by the government,” Mr. Atwood
declared, “one object at least should be to turn out well
informed and patriotic citizens, and the best possible way
to do that is to give them an understanding of the meaning
of the Constitution and a high regard for its wise provisions.”
Mr. Atwood is, moreover, sympathetic with those
who maintain that “teachers in the public schools should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
be impressed with the fact that their salaries are paid at
public expense.”<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>The sentiment of the Better America Federation of California
regarding the study of the Constitution in the schools
is not unlike that of the Constitution Anniversary Association.
Mr. Woodworth Clum in “America is Calling,”
a pamphlet to the students in high schools and colleges, sets
forth the tenets of his organization, in his declaration that
he would like to see “every school and college student in
America not only learn the <i>Preamble</i> to the Constitution so
that they could repeat it verbatim at any time or any place,
but ... also have them know its <i>meaning</i> so well that
when they repeat it they would recall the entire philosophy
of the American government.”<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> Much apprehension was
felt by the Better America Federation because of “groups
of free thinkers or radicals” agitating for some other form
of government under which there would be “no profits ...
in business.”<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>In accord with an interest in education evident in its
earliest meetings, the American Federation of Labor has
carried on investigations as to the character of teaching and
the content of textbooks in the social studies. In 1903, the
Executive Council was directed “to secure the introduction
of textbooks that will be more in accord with modern
thought upon social and political economy, books that will
teach the dignity of manual labor, give due importance to
the service that the laborer renders to society, and that will
not teach the harmful doctrine that the wage-workers should
be content with their lot, because of the opportunity that
may be afforded a few of their number rising out of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
class, instead of teaching that the wage earners should base
their hopes upon the elevation of the conditions of the
working people.”<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>In 1919, the Executive Council was instructed “to appoint
a committee to investigate the matter of selecting, or
of preparing and publishing textbooks appropriate for
classes of workers,” because the convention found “one of
the chief difficulties in securing appropriate classes for the
workers is the dearth of unbiased and suitable textbooks.”<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>The committee thus appointed reported in 1920 an insufficient
and inaccurate teaching of industrial growth and of
the trade union movement. The responsibility for this condition
was assessed upon the economists of the past “whose
teachings still largely dominate in the educational institutions
of our time,”—teachings “which have failed to stand
the test of experience and of unbiased investigation.” Ideas
held faulty were thought, furthermore, to be in no small
measure the outgrowth of ideas gained from books failing
to “state accurately and interpret correctly economic laws
and their application to our modern industrial society.”<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
The Committee therefore recommended the preparation of a
textbook by a competent trade unionist under the direction
of the executive officers of the American Federation of
Labor with a special committee for this purpose, and “the
teaching of unemasculated industrial history embracing an
accurate account of the organization of the workers and of
the results thereof, the teaching of principles underlying
industrial activities and relations, and a summary of legislation,
state and federal, affecting industry.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>The attention of the convention was focussed in its educational
program the following year upon a proposed investigation
of textbooks in civics, economics and history. The
committee to whom this task was delegated reported in 1922.
Their report, published in 1923, pointed out the importance
of “instruction in social and economic studies,” because such
studies are “vitally concerned with wide-spread understanding
of our social and economic institutions and forces.”<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
Yet the American Federation of Labor expressly denied a
desire to have their point of view “stressed to the exclusion
of all others.” They wanted merely “an emphasis commensurate
with its significance.” Nor did they wish “public
education to be influenced by partisan bodies of any kind.”
For they esteemed “the persons most competent to judge in
detail what should be taught and how it should be taught ...
those who are themselves engaged in the educational profession.”<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as “there are no more important determining
factors than the economic fabric to which the majority of
citizens contribute the larger share of their creative energy”
the Federation considered essential a knowledge of the
trade-union movement and “of all other social problems
having to do with the welfare of the working people.”<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
The information held important for the worker they felt
should be taught in the junior as well as in the senior high
school, in order to reach those students who leave school
early.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>In the consideration of the textbooks most commonly
used in the public schools, the Federation’s committee held
it “obvious that old-fashioned didactic methods of teaching
are not suitable to the new treatment,” that “subjects should
be presented not in the form of finished judgments and
dogmatic rules ... but rather as observations of the world
about us, concerning which the pupil must to a great extent
exercise his own judgments;” and that “in the case of highly
controversial subjects, important dissenting views should
be fairly and adequately presented.”<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> Although special
pleaders for some change in common educational practice,
they asserted that “the labor movement, unlike selfish interests,
does not and cannot depend for public favor upon narrow
propaganda; what it wants and needs is the light of
day and freedom of opinion. The more people know, and
the more they think, the better in the long run for working
men and women, and for all our citizenship.”</p>

<p>As a consequence of their premises, the Committee applied
to the textbooks considered the following tests: “In
the first place, is the book of old, narrow type, or of the
newer and broader type? In the second place, is its general
method that which inculcates certain fixed principles which
may have been acceptable some time in the past, or, on the
other hand, that which portrays society as a group of growing
and changing institutions? In the third place, does it
include adequate information about important subjects,
particularly subjects of concern to the wage-earning population,
such as trade-unionism, collective bargaining, standards
of living, hours of work, safety and sanitation, housing,
unemployment, civil liberty, and the judicial power? And
in its treatment of these subjects, does it fairly present
labor’s point of view as well as that of others?”<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The application of these tests to one hundred twenty-three
textbooks—forty-seven histories, forty-seven civics,
twenty-five economics, and four sociologies, revealed that
fifty-five per cent were of “the newer type dealing with
the broader aspects of government, and the social and industrial
life of the people rather than with forms of organization,
military events and abstract themes.” Sixty per
cent were found to be “dynamic rather than static in
their method of treatment” in that they recognized “to a
greater or less degree the power for growth in our institutions.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Committee decided that “a
majority of texts fell short of the standards in one or more
important respects,”<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> although, on the whole, “the newer
type of text” attempted “to give the labor movement in the
problem of industry adequate and just consideration.”<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
Failure to do so the Committee attributed either “to ignorance
of the author or to a hesitancy to deal with this difficult
subject, rather than to a deliberate attempt to keep the
facts of industry out of the schools.” The survey found
“no evidence that text books are being used for propaganda
purposes.”<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>The Public Service Institute through its chairman also has
urged a more extensive study of “labor civics,” and commended
the New York course in civics for older grammar
grade children and first year high school pupils.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>Still others have become censors of the character of social
study instruction in the public schools. Books treating the
modern problems of race, labor and capital, immigration,
private property, and topics of like nature have been examined
with a critical eye. The portrayal of facts relating
to races and nationalities in the United States has proved a
fruitful source of attack. Authors have been asked to omit
or make colorless references to controversial topics in the
preparation or the revision of textbooks which would discuss,
for example, the Chinese and Japanese in America, the
Italians and the Jews. In one city the negroes protested the
use of a textbook because of a statement to the effect
that the Southern white man tried to keep the negro
from voting, the protest carrying enough weight to cause
a special edition of the book to be printed for use in that
city.</p>

<p>Its presentation of the subject of private property was the
source of an attack upon Berry and Howe’s <i>Actual Democracy</i>,
“an elementary discussion” of present-day problems
in America. Exception was taken to children being taught
that “private property is one of the fundamental institutions
of American democracy ... an unmistakable index
of social progress ... [which] cannot be destroyed without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
destroying also the ideals of liberty and democracy in
which Americans believe.”<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p>Its method of discussing trade-unionism<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> and immigration
likewise met disfavor. In the case of the latter subject,
the critics were disturbed because, among other things, the
authors concluded “that the immigration situation has rendered
necessary a profound change in the very structure of
our government. [For] in order to control the turbulent
non-American elements, we have been compelled to modify
many of our earlier democratic ideals and to adopt centralization
of authority, which is far different in spirit from
American traditions ... [and] that [due to immigration]
American democracy is facing a life and death struggle with
Marxian socialism.”<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a></p>

<p>In treating freedom of speech the author of the secondary
school textbook is to no less degree upon slippery ground,
for here again critics have acclaimed partisanship and bias
evident in discussions. On this charge A. T. Southworth has
been adjudged guilty in his <i>The Common Sense of the Constitution
of the United States</i> in that he says, “This amendment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
[the first amendment] also guarantees the right of free
speech. There can, of course, be no such thing as absolute
free speech. The only persons who say exactly what they
think every minute of the day are babies and fools....
There is reason in all things, and on general principles a
person may say in this country anything he pleases, provided
what he says is not libelous or slanderous, or contrary to the
public morals; and provided that he does not advocate the
overthrow of the government by force. In this country
where we have a government, not of men but of laws, it is
not reasonable that anyone should preach the overthrow of
the government by force. If B says, ‘Murder A, throw
him out of office, and let me rule,’ then it is perfectly logical
for C to advocate the murder of B after B has set himself
up as a ruler. This is anarchy.”<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>The allegation that textbook-making has been directed by
“Big Business” has also been made. As a case in point,
Hughes’s <i>Text-Book in Citizenship</i> has been cited as one
which carries many illustrations printed “by courtesy” of
such corporations as the Carnegie Steel Company, the International
Harvester Company and the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> “And,” according to the critic, “it is not
pictures of blast furnaces with sweating men ... but pictures
of Americanization schools ... factory gardens ...
model factory buildings ... and a group of twenty-four
elderly men, who having labored for thirty-five years each in
the employ of the Carnegie Steel Company are posed at the
annual picnic given to the employees as a reward for services
rendered.”<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> A section in the same textbook, “Employers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
of the Right Sort,” in which is discussed profit sharing by
the employees of the United States Steel Company, also met
with disapproval. Equally disliked was Mr. Hughes’s discussion
of the I. W. W. because he said: “It is hard to see
how a right-thinking American can possibly indulge in such
performances or hold such theories. A decent man finds it
difficult to sympathize with even oppressed people who use
any such means to have their grievances corrected.”<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The
textbook was further adjudged biased in its discussion of
Lenin and Trotsky as “two able and unscrupulous leaders”
and of the anarchists whom “no civilized people can tolerate.”<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
On the other hand, the same author’s book <i>Economic
Civics</i> was attacked by a member of the American Car
Company of Berwick, Pennsylvania, on the ground of being
“Bolshevistic.”</p>

<p>Other books have incurred the disapproval of business
interests. <i>American Economic Life</i> by Henry Reed Burch
has been charged with being “unfair” in its treatment of
monopolies for saying: “Trolley lines, subways and ’bus
companies often possess great monopoly power. For example,
in a city of one million and a half the competitive
cost of transportation perhaps does not exceed three or four
cents a passenger, yet the actual price paid by the passenger
is usually from five to eight cents. This difference between
the price paid and the competitive price represents the
extent of the monopoly power.”<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>Many business organizations have interested themselves
in a program for education not only among their own employees
but among the people in general. Pamphlets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
other published materials have in this way been distributed
to set forth the point of view held desirable. Such a motive
doubtless led to a survey of books dealing with the subject
of banking in 1919 by the American Bankers Association.
The examination of the books induced the Association
through their Public Education Commission to publish and
distribute a series of talks to be given in the schools, since
the books examined were, on the whole, found to be “prepared
from the standpoint of bankers, and not the standpoint
of the mass of students who attend high school.”<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
The talks were designed to be delivered by bankers to pupils
in the eighth grade, the senior year of the high school, and
to civic, business and fraternal organizations in order to
acquaint people more thoroughly with methods of banking.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>During the World War the preparation of a series of lessons
entitled <i>Lessons in Community and National Life</i> under
the auspices of the Bureau of Education and the Food Administration
provoked adverse criticism from the National
Industrial Conference Board. In the lessons topics pertinent
to a study of community civics were treated, and
included discussions on international trade relations, manufacturing
methods, labor organizations and similar subjects.
To these, exception was taken, and it was asserted that
“opinions on controversial subjects are frequently introduced
into the Lessons by suggestion rather than by direct
statement, and through the whole fabric is woven a thread
of propaganda in favor of the eight-hour day, old age pensions,
social insurance, trade-unionism, the minimum wage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and similar issues.”<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> A “partisan” attitude was said to
be expressed in such a statement as: “We are told that in
the United States somebody is injured while at work every
fifteen seconds, and somebody is killed every fifteen minutes.
We cannot wonder at this when we realize how many dangers
there are in modern industry.”<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> According to <i>The</i>
[New York] <i>World</i>, Magnus N. Alexander, managing director
of the National Industrial Conference Board, alarmed
a convention of the National Boot and Shoe Manufacturers’
Association when he told them that these lessons were
spreading “insidious, unwarranted propaganda, particularly
injurious for reading by youth in the plastic age when youth
is inclined to take for granted and as proved all that is
said through the medium of the books in his classroom.”<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>These criticisms caused editorial comment in different
periodicals throughout the country. <i>The Capital Daily
Press</i> of Bismarck, North Dakota, declaring that “for generations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the reactionaries have maintained their grip on
the control of our educational institutions, and from the
kindergarten to college the ‘plastic minds of our youth’
have been sedulously taught the superior sacredness of
private property and the supremacy of dollar rights over
human rights. This is one thing which has made political
and industrial progress so slow.”<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a></p>

<p>To the editor of <i>The School Review</i> the whole discussion
furnished “a legitimate opportunity to call attention to the
fact that the schools have been very deficient in times past
in their treatment of social problems.” He felt that the time
had come “when there ought to be a very clear and explicit
assertion on the part of educational people that they will not
be dominated by such criticism as here presented,” for he
believed “the schools of a democracy have a right to discuss
democratic and popular matters.”<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

field must always arouse our admiration.” Muzzey, <i>An American History</i>,
pp. 372-373.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_497" href="#FNanchor_497" class="label">[497]</a> Rutherford, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 104. In her chapter entitled “Reconstruction
was not just to the South. This injustice made the Ku Klux Klan a
necessity,” Miss Rutherford, pursuing a policy peculiarly inharmonious for
a writer of <i>Truths of History</i>, allowed herself again to become negligent as
to the accuracy of her quotations. Citing Muzzey as one authority for the
title of her chapter, she ascribed the following statement to him: “The
rules of these negro governments of 1868 was an indescribable orgy of
extravagance, fraud and disgusting incompetence—a travesty on government.
Unprincipled politicians dominated the States’ government and
plunged the States further and further into debt by voting themselves
enormous salaries, and reaping in many ways hundreds of thousands of
dollars in graft. In South Carolina $200,000 were spent in furnishing the
State Capitol with costly plate glass mirrors, lounges, armchairs, a free bar
and other luxurious appointments for the use of the negro and scalawag legislators. It took the South nine years to get rid of these governments.”
In reading Muzzey’s book, the reader cannot but wonder at the reason for
the inaccuracy of the quotation, for precisely the same end would have been
accomplished had Miss Rutherford quoted verbatim: “The Reconstruction
governments of the South were sorry affairs. For the exhausted states,
already amply ‘punished’ by the desolation of war, the rule of the negro
and his unscrupulous carpetbagger patron was an indescribable orgy of
extravagance, fraud, and disgusting incompetence,—a travesty on government.
Instead of seeking to build up the shattered resources of the South
by economy and industry, the new legislators plunged the states further
and further into debt by voting themselves enormous salaries and by
spending lavish sums of money on railroads, canals, and public buildings
and works, for which they reaped hundreds of thousands of dollars in
graft.” In a footnote Muzzey adds the following from which Miss Rutherford
has culled the idea for part of her quotation: “The economic evils
and social humiliation brought on the South by the Reconstruction governments
are almost beyond description. South Carolina, for example, had
a legislature in which 98 of the 155 members were negroes ...; in one
year $200,000 was spent in furnishing the state capitol with costly plate-glass
mirrors, lounges, desks, armchairs, and other luxurious appointments,
including a free bar for the use of the negro and scalawag legislators. It
took the Southern states from two to nine years to get rid of these governments.”

character, undoubtedly went too far in his endeavors to procure financial
success. He insisted indeed on the necessity of contrition and confession
for all those who wished to obtain the remission of temporal punishment
for themselves; but his teaching concerning the indulgence for the
dead was not free from serious errors. To secure this benefit for a soul
which has, of course, departed this life in the state of grace, nothing,
according to him, is required but the alms. This doctrine, though at his
time actually taught by some irresponsible preachers, has never been supported
by ecclesiastical authority. Tetzel’s own brethren in religion openly
reproached him for his ill-advised tactics, which soon became the talk of
the whole country.” Betten and Kaufman, <i>The Modern World</i>, p. 376.</p>

that the doctrine of the Church concerning the remission of sins
was altogether wrong. He thereby implied that Christ, contrary to His
solemn promise, had allowed the Church to fall into a most disastrous
error. The new system, which gradually developed in Luther’s mind, confused
the nature of sin with concupiscence, which is a consequence of original
sin, and while it makes man inclined to sin is no sin in itself. By the
sin of Adam, he thought human nature was corrupted beyond recovery;
man’s acts can only be bad; but Jesus Christ covers the soul with His
infinite merits, which, as it were, conceal all trespasses from the eye of the just God; if sinful man expresses his firm ‘belief’ in this merciful dispensation,
God will not punish him, though the sin is not taken away,
but merely covered; the sinner therefore remains a sinner;.... It is
evident that such a justification is no justification at all, and it will always
remain a riddle how Luther could maintain that he had found such a
monstrous doctrine in the Bible.” <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 377-378.</p>

and religious as well</i>. It is true that present economic conditions are far
from satisfactory. Though production, on account of the introduction of
machinery, has increased enormously, wages have not kept pace with that
increase.... But the moral and religious causes are not to be overlooked.
The breaking loose from practical Christianity, so characteristic
of the last two centuries, has developed an intense selfishness, a struggle
for wealth in which each one seeks his own material advantage at the
expense of his neighbor.... What, then, are the remedies proposed by
Catholics? Certainly not the adoption of Socialist views.... The Socialists
deliberately ignore, yea exclude, religion from coöperation in the
solution of the great social problem. They forget that man’s happiness
here below is not his ultimate end, that the Creator did not want equal
wealth and equal material advantages for all.... The state having at
heart the temporal welfare of its citizens, should by wise legislation protect
the workers, their health, and morals, and that of their family. But the
change of hearts which is so necessary for the cure of modern evils is the
principal task of religion. Hence the Church should be free to carry out
her mission.” <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 630-641.</p>

<p>The National Lutheran Council had, in 1923, a committee on history
textbooks, whose purpose was to make known any “flagrant or
actual misrepresentations” of their church in history textbooks used in
the United States. Letter from Lauritz Larsen, President of the National
Lutheran Council to the author under date of January 13, 1923. No
report of the committee was given. The writer of the letter also stated
that there had been no “organized effort to suggest the content of history
textbooks in the public schools, not even as this might pertain to the
teaching of the history of the Reformation in the public schools.”</p>

<p>According to Werner, Brigham Young “insisted that the school-books
should be published in Utah, and written there if possible, rather than
imported at unnecessary expense from the East. The teachers, too, he
wrote should be Latter-day Saints, so that the children might learn only
what they ought to know.” Werner, M. R., <i>Brigham Young</i> (New York,
1925), p. 451.</p>

character such as slight cuts, scratches and slivers. Take, however, at its
face value the statement that somebody is killed every fifteen minutes
while at work. On the basis of a 54-hour work-week, approximately the
average in this country, this means a total of 11,250 deaths in industry
per year ... the scholar should also be given an idea of the millions of
workers to whom this total of deaths is related. He should in fairness
also have pointed out to him the hazards of non-industrial pursuits which
cause annually more fatal accidents than occur in industry.” The National

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="smcap">The Attack on History Textbooks Since 1917</span></h3></div>


<p>Since the World War, an ardent patriotism has swept the
country, resulting in a widespread investigation of the teaching
and writing of history. Sponsored by various groups,
the movement has gained considerable momentum, until
history teaching and history textbooks are in danger of being
an expression of certain religious, racial or other partisan
opinions. These groups hold, in common, that American
histories, as now written, neglect heroic characters in American
history, especially in the Revolutionary War, and that
they are distorted by a pro-British bias. Propaganda, indeed,
makes strange bed-fellows. In this new praetorian
guard of the temple of American patriotism are found the
Hearst newspapers, an element of the Knights of Columbus
and of the Irish-Americans, the German-Americans, and
finally patriotic societies of this country.</p>

<p>The charge of “Anglicization,” usually enlivened by mysterious
references to “British gold,” arises in part from
the new trend of American historical scholarship in the last
twenty-five years. Historians employing scientific methods
have done much to revise the traditional ideas concerning
our relations with Great Britain. Important contributions
of this character have been made, for instance, by such
historians as George Louis Beer, Charles M. Andrews, Herbert
L. Osgood, Sydney George Fisher, and Claude H. Van
Tyne.</p>

<p>These investigations were going forward at the same time
that conscious efforts were being made by the publicists of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
the two countries to reveal to the two English-speaking peoples
their common ties and responsibilities in the world
today. Many books were printed and organizations formed
to promote Anglo-American concord; among the latter, such
bodies as the Sulgrave Institute, the Anglo-American League
and the English-Speaking Union.</p>

<p>To suspicious onlookers the work of the historians in their
cloisters took on the appearance of deliberate propaganda
favorable to Great Britain—a suspicion, it need hardly be
said, entirely unwarranted. It needed only an appeal such as
that of Herbert Adams Gibbons that we solidify an amicable
relationship with Great Britain through our common language,
common ideals and common interests, to confirm the
credulous in their suspicions.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Furthermore, suggestions
from men like Albert Bushnell Hart that our history text-books
be rewritten to encourage better international relations
seemed to afford additional proof that pro-British
agencies were in control of history textbooks.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> The writings
of special pleaders like Owen Wister strengthened this impression.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Indeed, Charles Edward Russell has gone so far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
as to declare that definitely planned attempts to rewrite
American history textbooks, for the purpose of encouraging
better Anglo-American relations, were launched as early as
1896, and have been carefully carried on since then.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, the proponents of revision, conscious
of an “agitation for the reintroduction of parochial patriotism
into the schools and colleges,” have entered a plea for
“the truth” in school histories and for the writing and
teaching of history by scholars unaffected by the demands
of “politicians.”<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> To them, the true fount of patriotism
does not arise from textbooks of history which are “nationalistic
rather than impartial.”<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> They would seek, rather,
to depict events not as “partisans” but in a “scientific
spirit, with the desire to understand rather than to justify.”<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>


<h4>ATTACKS ON HISTORY TEXTBOOKS BY THE HEARST NEWSPAPERS
AND CHARLES GRANT MILLER</h4>

<p>In 1921 the Hearst newspapers began the publication of a
series of articles designed to arouse “patriotic American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
parents” to a realization that “the school histories now
being taught to their children have been revised and in some
instances wholly rewritten in a new and propitiatory spirit
toward England.”<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> Since that time these articles have appeared
at irregular intervals from the pen of Charles Grant
Miller. There has been yeast in his statements, and to them
may be attributed the origin of much of the criticism directed
against history textbooks by individuals and organized
groups. With titles set up in large black-faced type
these articles captured the eye of those who, consciously or
unconsciously, were giving heed to the feverish propaganda
which has flourished since the World War. In his articles,
Mr. Miller proceeded from the discussion of “United States
History Revised in School Books, Belittles Revolution and
Thanks England for Bestowing Liberty on America” to
a treatment of “Propaganda seeks to Distort American
History, British Workers are Being Backed by a Heavily
Financed Machine....”<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>

<p>Chief among the historians whom Mr. Miller would characterize
as “Anglicized” are found Albert Bushnell Hart,
John P. O’Hara, Everett Barnes, A. C. McLaughlin, C. H.
Van Tyne, William B. Guitteau, and Willis Mason West.
Charges of “Anglicization” have been brought also against
C. H. Ward for his edition of Burke’s <i>Speech on Conciliation
with America</i> and upon Helen Nicolay for her <i>Book of
American Wars</i>. The pro-British point of view which Mr.
Miller found expressed has been brought about by “intrigue
and treason” and the American school histories which portray
it “must be cast out if America is to remain America.”<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>Substantially all of the criticisms of history textbooks in
which Mr. Miller has indulged have related to statements
regarding the Revolutionary War. He found it especially
objectionable when a history like John P. O’Hara’s gives
“the impression” that “the American Revolution originated
not in the colonies themselves, but among the devoted
friends of liberty in England,” and when “more quotation
is given from Pitt than from Patrick Henry.”<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> A “wholesome
desire for increased friendship and coöperation between
the United States and Great Britain,” declared Mr.
Miller, “creates no justification for the policy of propitiation
of England through defamation of America, which offers as
sacrifice upon the altar of international comity immortelles
snatched from the monuments of our nation’s heroic
founders.... In our own heroes and history our nation
has been exceptionally blessed. They have proved unfailing
sources of pride and inspiration that have prompted us as
a people to stanch character, high endeavor, noble achievements
and unparalleled progress.”<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p>The second article in the Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i>
lay bare the alleged defects in Barnes’ textbook, where the
author plays “the part of a flunky apologist to England for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
the independence established by our fathers,” and in which
he “burlesques its world affecting results.”<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Barnes, furthermore,
Mr. Miller pointed out, ignores such patriots as
“Nathan Hale, whose only regret on the British scaffold
was that he had but one life to give to his country, ...
Ethan Allen, Mad Anthony Wayne and the battle of Stony
Point,” while, on the other hand, “there is a full page of
praise for the traitor Benedict Arnold whom ‘Congress had
treated unfairly.’”<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> In addition to other faults, Mr. Miller
cited the statements that “the first signer of the Declaration
of Independence was a smuggler,” “that the Continental
Congress ‘was a scene of petty bickerings and schemings’
among ‘selfish, unworthy, short-sighted, narrow-minded,
office-seeking and office-trading plotters,’ that ‘half the
colonists were loyal to England’; that the rest were united
in resistance only ‘because they dared not be otherwise,’
and that if in England the wise course had only prevailed
against the ‘foolish’ King, ‘this great country would probably
now have been a great branch of the British
empire.’”<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>Barnes was also condemned because he calls the War of
1812 “a mistake,” the burning of Washington “an act of
reprisal” for the burning of buildings in Canada, and Jackson’s
victory at New Orleans “a wasted battle; a needless
victory.”<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> How different to Mr. Miller was “this new
Barnes” from the Barnes’ <i>Brief History of the United
States</i> which spoke “always from the American viewpoint,
with American interests and sympathies at heart!”<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>The next authors to arouse his ire were McLaughlin and
Van Tyne, who with other historians were “reshaping”
American history “to serve international interests under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
whose hypnotism of propaganda American public opinion
has been goose-stepping for five years in the direction of a
return to English subjection.”<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Charged with omitting
Hale, Decatur, Faneuil Hall, the Green Mountain Boys,
Betsy Ross and the flag, the quartering of troops and “the
British attempts to bribe,” they were declared guilty also
of “strictly minimizing the patriot valor at Lexington,
Bunker Hill and New Orleans.” Such omission in the school
histories Mr. Miller compared with “an ancient custom to
remove the viscera and brain before embalming a body.”
Indeed, Mr. Miller found it extremely objectionable that
the “leading founders of our liberties are characterized by
McLaughlin and Van Tyne as follows: ‘It is hard to realize
how ignorant and superstitious were most of the colonists of
America’—p. 134; ‘Patrick Henry, a gay, unprosperous
and hitherto unknown country lawyer’—p. 141; ‘Smuggling
was so common that even a leading Boston merchant
was known as ‘the Prince of Smugglers’’—p. 140; ...
and ‘Adams and Hancock stole away across the fields’—p.
153.”<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>Besides these grievances the Hearst papers objected to the
omission of “such famous slogans as ‘We have met the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
enemy and they are ours’ and ‘Don’t give up the ship’”;
and McLaughlin and Van Tyne “go further [even] than
their fellows and seek to destroy these inspiring slogans by
disputing their authenticity.”<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

<p>This attack on the McLaughlin and Van Tyne textbook
provoked a protest from C. H. Ward, whose edition of
Burke’s <i>Speech on Conciliation with America</i> the Hearst
papers also had criticized. “Mr. Miller,” declared Ward,
“skillfully quotes with a sneer from the McLaughlin and
Van Tyne book” (regarding Patrick Henry). “Yet this
book,” he asserted, “does in fact give more than usual
prominence and praise to Patrick Henry: ‘Who declared
with marvelous eloquence’ (p. 141); ‘With burning words
he denounced the tyranny’ (p. 142); ‘Patrick Henry
again electrified the Virginia leaders by his daring prophecy’
(p. 150); ‘Securing a commission and money from the
Governor of Virginia, Patrick Henry’ (p. 182).” Notwithstanding
this treatment of Henry, Mr. Ward averred that
“Mr. Miller so quotes as to imply that the authors have
slandered Henry; but the two adjectives ‘gay and unknown’
are the only two words that convey aught but
praise.”<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Further, Mr. Ward showed that, in the account
of Lexington, the statement that “Adams and Hancock
stole away” is taken out of its context. Ward, likewise,
found that Miller has “misrepresented” Hart’s history, for
he was unable to discover some of the statements attributed
to that author.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>On November 20, 1921, the Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i>
devoted an article to an attack not only upon Barnes, Hart,
McLaughlin and Van Tyne, but also upon William B. Guitteau,
who, too, had fallen victim to “the snobbish spirit of
apology and subserviency to England.”<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> This attitude,
according to Mr. Miller, “the publishers, Silver, Burdett
and Company, boldly proclaim in their advertisements” in
saying: “This book has been written in the light of recent
events in which a new atmosphere has been created for the
study of our national life.... The revolutionary war and
subsequent Anglo-American difficulties hitherto distorted
in our school books through an unthinking adherence to
traditional prejudice, have been restated by Dr. Guitteau in
their true light.”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<p>One of the objectionable points urged against Guitteau
and other historians was the ignoring of Irish patriots. In
large, bold-faced type Mr. Miller called attention to “the
elimination of German and Irish assistance to the colonists
in the Revolution, as well as the Dutch of New York and
Pennsylvania, the French of Carolina and the Swedes of
New Jersey and Delaware, while the help given by France
is minimized and charged to selfish, scheming motives.”<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
In his earlier editions, declared Mr. Miller, Professor Hart
had the “frankness to say ‘Germans, Irish, Scotch-Irish,
French, Dutch, Negroes and Englishmen stood side by side
in the ranks,’” but in the revised edition of 1920 “he has
magically transformed so eminent a hero as Baron De Kalb
from a German to a Frenchman.”<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Home grown motives might be imagined for carrying
back a century and a half the cancellation of friendly relations
with the Germans,” was Mr. Miller’s observation, “but
whence comes the motive for a sudden change in attitude
toward Irish heroes of the Revolution?” Such a situation
revealed to Miller a significant animus, for certainly “it is
not our own country that has had the trouble with the Irish.”
To him it was conceivable that hidden forces were actuating
the “recent revisions,” for “by the early historians” the
high regard in which George Washington held Irishmen was
“glowingly recognized.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>The publication of this “series of articles written for the
Hearst newspapers by Charles Grant Miller ... aroused a
wave of indignation all over the country,” according to the
Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i> for May 14, 1922. As a
result, “patriotic societies have taken up the battle and
various organizations have started movements to stop such
perversion of American traditions.” As an example of one
who was aroused to the situation described in the articles,
the <i>Herald and Examiner</i> published a letter from Senator
William E. Borah, “who raises a clarion voice against the
insidious effort to falsify the glorious story of the American
fight for independence and to cheat the youth of this day
of the heroic inspiration and sturdy manhood of the days of
the Revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>Although Senator Borah did not desire “to have our histories
do any injustice to Great Britain,” yet he did not want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
“facts concealed nor events ignored in order to satisfy those
who now seem to regret that their ancestors ever came to this
country.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> He presumed that the next step would be “an
expurgated edition” of the Declaration of Independence,
which would be read “with appropriate apology” on the
Fourth of July “should that continue to be observed.” All
of this led him to remark that in “due time some sycophantic
intellectual interloper will feel constrained to urge that
we withhold from our young men and women the unjust
attack so long made upon the American-English gentleman
known as Benedict Arnold.”<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>Under the caption “Let United States History Teach
Patriotism,” Wallace McCamant, one-time president of the
Sons of the American Revolution, announced his approval
of the stand taken by Charles Grant Miller. “What think
you of a school history,” queried Judge McCamant, “which
begins the story of the American Revolution with this sentence?
‘There is little use trying to learn whose fault it
was that the war began, for, as we have seen, such a long
train of events led to disagreement between England and
America, that we should have to go back and back in the
very founding of the colonies. As in most quarrels, the
blame is laid by each party on the other.’”<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> When an
author, in discussing taxation without representation declares
that “there was here an honest difference of opinion,”
it was evident to Judge McCamant that he “has certainly
not been called of God to write American history.”<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>To those “who say that history should not stress war,”
Judge McCamant admitted that “there are important chapters
in our peace history which should be adequately covered,”
but he suggested that there is “nothing else” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
“will grip the imagination of the young like the story of the
soldier or the sailor who fights and dies that his country may
be free.”<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> The inculcation of patriotism, which is the chief
value in the teaching of American history in Mr. McCamant’s
mind, can best be attained in setting forth “sacrifices
in winning freedom.”<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>The next angle from which Mr. Miller criticized American
school histories is in “the magical transformation of King
George III from a born Briton into a German.”<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Such, he
asserted appears in the 1916-17 edition of the school history
by Hart, a plain evidence of “the forces of British propaganda”
which “were increasing their influences to quicken
an American hatred of Germany and to hurry us into war
and into permanent alliance....”<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> To prove his contention
regarding the nationality of King George III, he quoted
the “English historical authority, Macaulay,” thus: “‘The
young King was a born Englishman. All his tastes and
habits, good and bad were English.’”<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>As a result of the “many forces actively at work” Mr.
Miller observed that the “Anglicized revisionists, like ten
automatons worked by one will, begin to teach American
school children: ‘that the American revolution was made
in Germany; ...’ that ‘the American revolution was a
contest between German tyranny and English freedom, although
neither party in the struggle knew that this was the
issue’; ....”<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> On the other hand, Mr. Miller found in
John Bach McMaster’s history “an excellent summary”
where “the venomous quality of English comments upon
America is vividly described.”<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>Another victim of “Anglicization” Mr. Miller held to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Matthew Page Andrews, “director of the English-Speaking
Union and Anglicized author of three American school histories”
whose source of information was Greg’s <i>History of
the United States</i>, published in London in 1887.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> It was
the belief of Mr. Miller that it was Greg’s <i>History</i> from
which Mr. Andrews adduced the conclusion that “Lincoln
was controlled by fanatics and through perfidy and broken
pledges forced our Civil War.”<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> In his discussion of Greg’s
book, Mr. Miller failed to mention Greg’s characterization
of Townshend’s work. In this latter case it would seem that
Greg ought to have met with approval, for he described
Townshend’s part in the Revolution as “folly,” as well as
saying that Townshend “pledged himself to a series of petty
customs imposts.”<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Furthermore, he mentions Ethan
Allen, Stark, Wayne, St. Clair, Putnam, Sumter and Marion,
and in that regard should prove acceptable to those desiring
the inclusion of heroic characters in textbooks.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>On October 15, 1922, the Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i>
sought to expose the agencies which ranged “all the way
from the cultivation of ‘more friendly relations’ to the fulfillment
of the Carnegie prophecy of the Reunited States, the
British-American Union and the Cecil Rhodes Design,”<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
and which were responsible for textbook revision. Besides
the “elaborate and well-oiled British propaganda machine
established by Sir Gilbert Parker and the late Lord Northcliffe,”
Mr. Miller had discovered “at least a full half dozen
of strong propaganda organizations” all of whose methods
were “sinister and to the one end.” Among these were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
“Sons of St. George, an old organization of British-born
residents of this country” who, “within the last few years,”
had “emerged from obscurity through a hard drive for increased
membership and vigorous assertion of British
spirit,” and who had offered “the only open opposition
which the Sons of the Revolution in California have encountered
in their winning fight against Anglicized school
histories....” In the California case, the opposition was
directed by “the American-born wife of a son of St. George
and from a daughter of the American Revolution who is a
member of the English-Speaking Union,” which exemplified
“the favorite policy of all of these British propaganda organizations”
in which they “push their American-born
women to the front to do their open fighting.”<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>The English-Speaking Union is another of the organizations
of which Mr. Miller spoke. Its magazine, <i>The Landmark</i>,
has “bitterly attacked as ‘demagogic’ and ‘narrow-minded’
the movement to restore true American history
to our public schools”;—and “it arranges for the granting
of degrees by English universities to American collegiates
who teach to our youth the imperialistic interests of Great
Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>The third agency for Anglicization, according to Mr.
Miller, is the Sulgrave Institute “founded upon the idea that
George Washington has loomed too large throughout the
world ever to be belittled, and so must be claimed as an
Englishman, who established in this western world English
freedom.” A like fate Mr. Miller prophesied for Lincoln<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
“for whom there is now being provided an English lineage
and an English ancestral home, as a shrine where expatriate
Americans may bend the sycophantic knee in foolish worship
of supposed English influences that are said to have freed
our slaves and saved our Union.”<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Other forces of like design Mr. Miller found in the “Cecil
Rhodes Scholarship, the Cecil Rhodes Secret Society and
the Rhodes Scholarship Alumni Association of America,” all
influences for Rhodes’ dream—“the ultimate recovery of
the United States of America as an integral part of the
British Empire.”<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Of like character are “the multiform
Carnegie institutions, supported by the $200,000,000 fund
of the Carnegie Corporation, and designed to influence and
direct the spirit and methods of the scholastic, public school
and library forces of the country,” as well as the religious
through the “Church Peace Union.”<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> The World Alliance
for Promoting International Friendship through the
Churches and The American Association for International
Coöperation are among the various influences named by
Mr. Miller, which seek to “Briticize” America.</p>

<p>One of the chief endeavors of “all of the propaganda
organizations,” according to Mr. Miller, is the substitution
of the observance of Magna Charta Day, June 15, for that
of July the fourth. Such an effort led him to conclude that
“the international mind is a British mind throughout.
While insidiously seeking to denationalize America, it is
insistently striving to strengthen the nationalism of Great
Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Mr. Miller held as chiefly responsible for
“this de-Americanizing ‘dope’” Nicholas Murray Butler
and “more than a score of college presidents and professors,
other educators and preachers, who readily are traced into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
other British propaganda organizations and are officially
identified with various British secret services in this country”;
who through a system of pensions are “securely subsidized
into keen sympathy with the Carnegie design of
‘the Reunited States—the British-American Union.’”<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>The inclusion in American history textbooks of statements
designed to show that American constitutional practices
had their source in English institutions caused Mr.
Miller to criticize not only Barnes, O’Hara, McLaughlin and
Van Tyne, against whom he had other grievances, but also
David Saville Muzzey and Willis Mason West. “Such is
not American history,” he declared, “it is British propaganda,”
for even an Englishman, Gladstone, has said, “The
American Constitution is the most wonderful work ever
struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of
man.”<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> “Such disparagement in revised school history
is not mere unintentional error,” asserted Mr. Miller. “...,
these and other gross alterations recently made in ten of
our school histories, are a direct result of definite design and
organized propaganda” conducted by “propaganda associations
pussyfooting among us ... to deaden our respect for
our own birthright, inoculate us with contempt for our free
institutions and fit us for coercion of re-colonization.”<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<p>On November 4, 1923, however, the <i>New York American</i>
carried a retraction of an attack on West’s <i>History of the</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
<i>American People</i> which “was printed in such a way as to
lead readers to believe ... that the statements [objected
to by the Hearst papers] ... were made without qualification.”
The <i>American</i> apologized for “inadvertently” publishing
part of a discussion in such a way as to distort “the
meaning of both paragraphs when read together.”<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>As a result of the agitation of the Hearst newspapers the
“treason texts” were being revised, according to the Chicago
<i>Herald and Examiner</i> of April 20, 1924. Among the
authors attempting to “re-Americanize” their histories
were David S. Muzzey, who already had made “three mincing
revisions,” Andrew C. McLaughlin and C. H. Van Tyne
who have “at last submitted to the irresistible force of
nation-wide protest against treason texts and have strikingly
reversed their views....”<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>However, Mr. Miller has not confined his activities solely
to the publication of articles in the Hearst newspapers, but
has resorted to other means for preaching his gospel.
Through the agency of an organization called the Patriot
League for the Preservation of American History he has
endeavored to carry on his war against the “British propagandists”
and “to purge the public schools of the Anglicized
school histories and establish in their stead textbooks
that teach the true American annals and inculcate the true
American spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> The slogan for the Patriot League is
taken from Washington’s <i>Farewell Address</i>: “Against the
insidious wiles of foreign influence, I conjure you to believe
me, fellow citizens, the jealousy of a free people ought to
be constantly awake; since history and experience prove
that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of
republican government.”<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Charges against “ten” Anglicized
school histories reincarnating “the spirit of Benedict
Arnold” have been made by the Patriot League in a pamphlet
entitled “<i>Treason to American Tradition</i>.” These
charges have been indorsed and the accused books condemned,
in formal resolutions unanimously adopted in their
national conventions by the American Legion, the Descendants
of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, the
Grand Army of the Republic, the Knights of Columbus,
the Sons of the American Revolution, and the United Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
War Veterans.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> The proscribed list includes books
under the authorship of Matthew Page Andrews, Albert
Bushnell Hart, John P. O’Hara, C. R. Ward, David Saville
Muzzey, Willis Mason West, William B. Guitteau, A. C.
McLaughlin and C. H. Van Tyne, Everett Barnes, and
Edwin Greenlaw. The Patriot League concludes that “the
heroic history of a nation is the drum and fife music to
which it marches,” and that “it makes a mighty difference
whether America continues to quickstep to ‘Yankee Doodle’
or takes to marking time to ‘God Save the King.’”<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>In commenting upon Mr. Miller’s pamphlet <i>The New
York Times</i> declared: “Mr. Miller attempts in this pamphlet,
through the quotation of isolated sentences and passages,
to prove that the authors whom he criticized have no reverence
for the Revolutionary leaders, preach the doctrine that
the colonists had no grievance against England, suppress all
the thrilling stories of valorous achievement on which our
youth used to be nourished, and make no use of authorities
other than British in commenting on the Revolution.</p>

<p>“What Mr. Miller does prove by all his toil is quite
different, namely, the undenied fact that our recent textbooks
dealing with the early days of the Republic have been
compiled by men whose purpose, so far as they had a purpose
in addition to that of supplying accurate information,
has been to promote friendship between Great Britain and
the United States rather than to perpetuate their ancient
animosities. That is a crime in Mr. Miller’s eyes, for he
holds and avows the strange belief that school histories
should be different for the children of different countries....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“To argue with an upholder of that grotesque theory
would be worse than waste of time. Fortunately, Mr. Miller
is alone in holding it, except, perhaps, for the company of
those whose hatred of England is so fierce that for them
any stone is good enough to throw at her....”<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>


<h4>AGITATION BY CATHOLICS AND IRISH</h4>

<p>A desire to combat the tendency of recent textbooks to
depict our relations with England from a viewpoint not violently
anti-British has led an element of the Knights of
Columbus to join in the movement for expurgating textbooks.
Their chief cause for complaint lies in the narration
of events of the American Revolution, the War of 1812,
and in England’s attitude toward the Federal Government
during the Civil War. Joseph T. Griffin, in a pamphlet,
<i>American History Must It Be Rewritten to Preserve Our
Foreign Friendships?</i> regretfully remarks that with the
present-day presentation of the Revolutionary War in our
histories, “it will soon require more courage for Americans
to believe the Declaration of Independence than it did for
Jefferson to write it.”<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Such a condition has arisen, according
to Mr. Griffin because of the fear of exciting antagonism
toward Great Britain, whereas “the only consideration
which should guide the American writer of a history
text-book is whether the material he is to present ... is
true as to facts, ennobling as to sentiment, and stimulating
to the morale of the nation; and that while we are eager to
preserve friendly relationships with other nations, we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
not willing to forego one iota of our national glory or consign
to oblivion any part of our historical traditions.”<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The charge that a definite campaign of British propaganda
had been carefully inaugurated, Edward F.
McSweeney, one-time head of the Knights of Columbus
Historical Commission, set forth in a pamphlet entitled
<i>America First</i>.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> “According to our modern Tories in their
propaganda Campaign,” declared Mr. McSweeney, “Washington
and his colleagues were wrong, and only the leaders
of an ignorant, criminal, and cruel mob. American independence
was only a sudden thought, and not the result of
long growth and development.”</p>

<p>In proof of the conspiracy charge the author showed by
actual figures the increase in the area of the English dominions
during the past three hundred years. This expansion
he ascribed to the wrecking “of every nation that
aspired to be her competitor for any considerable share of
the world’s commerce or for equality of political power
among the States of the world”; for by “intrigue, propaganda
and alliance” Great Britain has “destroyed the
commercial power of Spain, Holland, Denmark, France, and
as a result of the great world-war, of Russia, Austria-Hungary
and Germany.” Today, Mr. McSweeney pointed out,
there remain only two nations “which are real competitors
of England—Japan and the United States,” the former annexed
by secret treaties and alliances, the latter, in reality,
being the sole competitor.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>It was Mr. McSweeney’s belief that the first effort of the
pro-British propagandists “<i>to undermine the foundations of
our national life</i>” was “<i>by tampering with the children in</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
<i>the public schools</i>”; a movement which had “made substantial
progress,” for “the history of the Revolution has
been re-written to make it appear that the objections to a
connection with England, so important a hundred years ago,
have been to a large extent set aside, and that the time may
come when through some application of the Federal principle
... [the English-speaking people] may come together
into a vaster United States, the pathways to whose
scattered parts shall be the SUBJECTED seas.”<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>This movement, he held, had been aided by some of the
great publishing houses of the United States, citing the
words of George Haven Putnam, “the head of one of the
largest publishing houses in the country,” in a Fourth of
July speech made in London: “The feelings and prejudices
of Americans concerning their trans-Atlantic kinfolk were
shaped for my generation as for the boys of every generation
that had grown up since 1775 on textbooks and histories
that presented unhistorical, partisan and often distorted
views of the history of the first English colonies, of the
events of the Revolution, of the issue that brought about
the war of 1812-15, and the grievances of 1861-65....
Textbooks are now being prepared which will present a
juster historical account of events of 1775-83, 1812-15, and
1861-65.... It is in order now to admit that the loyalists
had a fair cause to defend, and it was not to be wondered
at that many men of the more conservative way of thinking
should have convinced themselves that the cause of good
government for the colonies <i>would be better served by maintaining
the royal authority and by improving the royal
methods, than by breaking away into the all-dubious possibilities
of independence</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>Some of the British proselytism, Mr. McSweeney attributed
to a propagandist campaign inaugurated by Lord
Northcliffe, who left “one hundred and fifty million dollars”
and “ten thousand agents” in this country.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> “Local
societies should be formed in every center to foster British-American
good-will, in close coöperation with an administrative
committee,” Lord Northcliffe is alleged to have said.
“<i>Important articles</i> should be broken up into <i>mouthfuls</i> for
<i>popular consumption</i>, and booklets, cards, pamphlets, etc.,
distributed through organized channels to the public. Advertising
space should be taken in the press, on the hoardings,
and in the street cars for steadily presenting terse,
easily read and remembered mind-compelling phrases and
easily grasped cartoons <i>that the public may subconsciously</i>
absorb the fundamentals of a complete mutual understanding.”
According to Mr. McSweeney, the influence of this
campaign is already evident in textbooks for primary grades
“in which more than ninety per cent of the pupils are children
of foreign born parents, or are themselves foreign
born.”<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> Authors of such textbooks, writers like Owen
Wister, Ex-President Taft, George Haven Putnam, Professor
William L. Cheney, Albert Shaw, President Judson of
the University of Chicago, Admiral Sims, and others are
arraigned by McSweeney and charged with un-Americanism.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
The condemnation of Wister is based, in part, on
his statement that our school histories have been responsible
for keeping George III’s memory green, but that “A movement
to correct the school books has been started and will
go on.”<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>Of all the propagandist arguments set forth by England
“the most dangerous and un-American” in the opinion of
the writer is that about “Anglo-Saxon civilization.” “By
dint of iteration and reiteration,” declared Mr. McSweeney,
“this uncontradicted falsehood has actually brought about
in the United States the subconscious acceptance of a misleading
idea, which during the last fifty years has grown,
until it is commonly used, yet nobody even knows what it
means.... The Anglo-Saxon tradition is a pure myth.
To verify it is like looking at midnight in a dark cellar for
a black cat that isn’t there.” Nor did he believe “the
Anglo-Saxon impulse ... in the least responsible for the
progress of the United States. It had nothing to do with
the Spanish in Florida; the Huguenots in Virginia; the
Swedes in Delaware and New Jersey; the Dutch in New
York and Pennsylvania, and the Celts in Maryland and
Pennsylvania.”<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, this antagonist of Great Britain sought to
controvert some of the statements which would show that
American institutions sprang largely from England. He
contended that never was there “a greater falsehood” than
the claim that the English were the founders of the New
England town meeting, for it arose from the Teutonic “folk
mote”; that it was unquestionably true that there is in
the United States scarcely a political or legal institution of
English origin; that the doctrine of the Declaration of
Independence that “all men are created equal” was of
Roman not English law; that the United States could not
get religious liberty from England, “because religious liberty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
did not exist there”; that popular education, freedom
of the press, the secret ballot, the vast machinery of public
charitable, reformatory and poor administration were derived
from other than English sources.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> With such an
exposition, Mr. McSweeney arrived at the conclusion that
the part of “our legal system which is consistent with natural
justice comes from Rome; the incongruous, absurd and
unjust features” from England.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>The place of the Irish race in the making of America,
Michael J. O’Brien, chief historiographer for the American
Irish Historical Society, sought to establish in <i>A Hidden
Phase of American History</i>. It proposes to set forth “Ireland’s
Part in America’s Struggle for Liberty” and to lay
bare “the heart of the Irish race in Ireland during the War
of Independence as beating in sympathy with the revolted
colonies in America,” to narrate the story of Irish contributions
to the Revolutionary army, and to establish a place
of preëminence for the Irish in the building of the Republic.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
It runs, in its twenty-four chapters, the gamut of the
history of most of the colonies, depicting the part played
by the Irish. It is offered as an antidote to Bancroft, Henry
Cabot Lodge, and other American historians, and concludes
its narrative with a chapter on “America’s Debt to Ireland”
in which is set forth the plea for American aid for
Ireland in her struggle for independence.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Of this book the <i>Irish World</i> speaks with enthusiasm:
“The most repulsive snake in popular opinion is the cobra,
famous in stories of East Indian life.... Yet a little
animal of the ferret type can kill him in a brief fight, ...
a frail but daring creature known as the mongoose.... In
the historical order we have the cobra, the repulsive serpent
who makes history a fountain of lies, whose fangs poison the
human race for centuries, whose history of the so-called
Reformation is the cobra of the past four centuries. The
Anglo-Saxon history of this continent is a cobra of the same
species. It has poisoned the life of the American people....
All the Anglo-Saxon writers from Bancroft on,
suppressed, ridiculed where they could not suppress, mutilated
where they could neither suppress nor ridicule, everything
Irish in American history. The Universities of
Harvard, Yale and Columbia have been conspicuous in
spreading the poison, for that matter in cultivating and
intensifying its virulence, as their historians are the best
illustrations of the cobra’s viciousness and malignity. The
Catholic faith at this moment cannot get a hearing from
them.... It is pleasant to announce that the mongoose
has arrived and is already at work. His name is Michael
J. O’Brien ... [who] has brought out a book ... called
‘A Hidden Phase of American History.’” His first battle
is with George Bancroft, “looked upon as our great historian,
our most dignified, honest and truthful writer....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
Saturated with the poison of the cobra George Bancroft
could no more see and tell the truth about the Catholics and
the Irish than Sir Edward Carson or Tom Watson,” but
O’Brien “will kill the Anglo-Saxon cobra in this country.
He is more important than twenty cathedrals and one million
orators. He should be provided with a pension of one hundred
dollars a week and let loose upon the libraries and
records of the Anglo-Saxon....”<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>During 1921 and 1922 the Knights of Columbus, acting
through an Historical Commission, promoted a movement
for original studies in American history by offering prizes
for original research. The purpose of the society was “to
encourage investigation into the origins and achievements
and the problems of the United States, to interpret and
perpetuate the American impulse, the impulse of the patriots
who founded and who through their successors, have preserved
the Republic; to promote American solidarity; and to
exalt the American ideal.”<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The session of the Supreme
Assembly which launched this project was held May 28,
1921, at Chicago. According to John H. Reddin, Supreme
Master, it was their “aim to enlist a commission of leading
historians of diverse racial extraction and religious denominations”
to prepare twenty-four pamphlets “covering critical
periods in the nation’s history; the matter to be written
direct from original sources,” and the pamphlets to be distributed
“in millions of copies to schools and colleges, legislators
and newspapers throughout the country.”<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>The Thirty-Ninth International Convention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
Knights of Columbus, with twenty thousand delegates in attendance,
met at San Francisco on August first. Among
the activities which were endorsed was the movement for a
“propaganda proof” history at the cost of one million
dollars,<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> by which, if necessity demanded, every town in the
country could be flooded with pamphlets telling “the true
tale of America’s great origin and America’s greatness” and
“stripped of all manner of European or Asiatic coloring.”<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>Shortly following this announcement of the plan of the
Knights of Columbus, Edward F. McSweeney, Chairman of
the Historical Commission, issued the following statement:
“The Knights of Columbus history movement aims at only
one thing—the preservation of truth in the writing of
American history. Many of the textbooks used in our
schools are utterly unreliable on important phases of the
nation’s story and totally disregard many cardinal events
and personages. The Knights of Columbus oppose the cause
of no other nation, they are simply aligning the 800,000
members of the order in the production and distribution of
a straight-forward story, free from propaganda of any kind
as to the origin and development of this country.”</p>

<p>“An attempt is even now being made,” continues the
statement, “and Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, President of
Columbia University, announced his advocacy of it recently
in London, to promote the celebration of the signing of the
Magna Charta in English-speaking countries. The anniversary
of the Magna Charta coming late in June, and being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the object of the celebration as the basis of liberty, which
it is not, would necessarily eclipse our own Independence
Day, which, I believe, is the ultimate object of the movement....
The Knights of Columbus believe that the
Declaration of Independence is an infinitely more important
and conclusive document than the Magna Charta.” Under
the compulsion of this belief they registered their opposition
to “this and other forms of un-American propaganda.”<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>In December the movement for “Americanized” histories
was furthered at a meeting held at Washington, D. C., and
the announcement was again made that the Knights of
Columbus would offer $7500 in prizes for monographs in
American history, the first prize to be $3000.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>According to <i>Columbia</i>, the organ of the Knights of
Columbus, their history program was attacked with “virulence”
by “certain organizations, dedicated to creating
better Anglo-American relations.” Thus, from the Loyal
Coalition of Boston emanated the following protest: “The
obvious intention of a certain group, with the approval of
the French ambassador, to rewrite the history of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
States, is an issue of the hour. Our whole educational system
is seriously menaced because of the influence of certain
instructors who react to aliens of hyphenated influence.”<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
The British-American Association also showed their opposition
by offering “a prize to be known as the John Adams
Gold Medal for the essay best setting forth the most instances
of the friendship of Great Britain toward America
from 1600 to 1920.” This hostility was clearly evident
to the Knights in the statement of the organization: “To
offset the work of the Fourth Degree Knights of Columbus
Historical Commission, whose Chairman, Edward F.
McSweeney, has declared that the English people, so far as
they had any voice, were substantially unanimous in their
attitude, opposing the aspirations of the Colonists for freedom
and backed up by the King and Parliament in continuing
the fight for Colonial Liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>

<p>Yet not all Catholics gave unqualified endorsement to the
Commission’s activities. January 1, 1924, Mr. McSweeney’s
chairmanship ceased. In commenting upon the changed
personnel of the Commission, <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>, a
Roman Catholic periodical, expressed the hope that reorganization
would “result in a more economical programme
and one that will really advance the cause of history.”<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>“The organization of this Commission in the first place
was a most extraordinary procedure,” stated the <i>Review</i>.
“A man whose work and training had never been in the field
of history, was chosen before the members of the Commission
were selected, and was given a salary that amounted
to more than twice the pay of a full professor of history in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
our larger universities!<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> When the personnel of the Commission
was announced, it was found to contain the name
of but one professional historian....<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Unfortunately, the
early statements appearing under the imprint of the Commission,
some utterances of the Chairman, and some articles
published in <i>Columbia</i>, were not calculated to remove the
existing impression that the Commission had no constructive
programme, ... and that the Chairman at least was willing
to follow ‘the historical expert’ of the Hearst syndicate
in the unjust, unfair, unmerited, and uncalled for attack
on certain history textbooks.”<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p>In the course of setting forth their arguments the pro-Irish
criticized certain textbooks in common use in the
public schools. Albert Bushnell Hart’s <i>School History of
the United States</i> was attacked because it “attempts to show
that the American Revolution was not justified” by the
following statements: “They [the colonists] were as well off
as any other people in the world. They were not desperately
oppressed,”<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and “they enjoyed more freedom and self-government
than the people in England.”<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> And again,
“Thousands of good people sincerely loved Great Britain
and were loyal to King George. The loyalists were harshly
put down.”<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Hart, moreover, includes statements whose
effect may be “unquestionably bad” upon “the impressionable
minds of the young,” according to one critic.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>It was also held that the “National spirit” of the pupils
will suffer inevitably from such expressions of a “propaganda
of palliation” as appear in McLaughlin’s <i>History of
the American Nation</i>. “And all this means that while we
speak, we shall probably always speak, of the struggle between
England and America, the war that ensued had many
of the features and many of the deplorable effects of a civil
war.” Besides, an attempt to abase the motives of the
Revolutionary patriots was plainly evident to objectors in
the assertion that “Trivial offenses on the part of governments
cannot justify revolution. Only oppression and serious
danger can justify war. It cannot be said that the
Colonies had actually suffered much. It might be even seen
that the mother country was not at all tyrannical in taxing
the Colonies to pay for defending them, and beyond question
George III and his pliant ministers had no interest in treating
the Colonies with cruelty.”<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

<p>Everett Barnes, too, was found culpable in assuming an
“apologetic attitude” toward the Revolution in his statement:
“The disputes that brought about the War were not
between the Colonists and all the English at home. They
were rather between the Tories and the Whigs on both
sides of the sea, neighbor against neighbor. Had the great
Whig party in England been in power with Edmund Burke
as its leader, it would have checked the King in his foolish
course.... Had there been no war, this great country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
would probably now be a great branch of the British Empire.”<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>
Another occasion for grievance was discovered in
teaching that the War of 1812 was “a mistake,” and “a
case in which righteous anger overcame judgment,” when,
in reality, “the events which preceded the declaration of
war were infinitely more humiliating to the young nation
than those which caused us to enter the World War.”<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a></p>

<p>When “Faneuil Hall, the cradle of liberty,” Nathan Hale,
the Swedes of New Jersey and Delaware, the Dutch of New
York, the Germans of Pennsylvania, the French of South
Carolina, the Irish both North and South are not mentioned
as a part of the Revolution or are practically ignored in the
struggle for American independence, the would-be revisionists
feel there is just cause for remonstrance.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> Therefore,
the Irish “solemnly protest” at “the diluted historical
fluid served by Barnes, Van Tyne, McLaughlin, Hart, and
others,”<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> for “Americans are not yet ready to accept a
King.”<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>
<p>GERMAN-AMERICAN AGITATION</p>

<p>Of similar purport has been the movement to disparage
“denatured” histories instituted by the Steuben Society, the
successor of the German-American Alliance. This organization
has taken its name from “the man that forged the tool
which overthrew British tyranny.” Its avowed purpose is
to battle against “the sinister efforts that threaten to pervert
historical truth and independence of thought in this fair
country of ours.”<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> The membership is composed of men
and women of the German race who are citizens of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
United States, excluding those who were “shifters and trimmers
during the War,” and “who are known to possess no
race pride.”<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The chief medium for the dissemination of
information is the <i>S. S. Bulletin</i>. An article appearing in
the issue of February 15, 1922, set forth the attitude of the
Steubenites toward history textbooks, and acknowledged the
indebtedness of the Society to the Hearst newspapers for
exposing “the conspiracy secretly to alter United States
school histories, so as to promote a British-American
union.”<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> In commenting upon the charge that school histories
were being edited by British propagandists, the <i>Bulletin</i>
pointed out that “the public school is the fountain head
of future citizenship. History teaching is the chief source
of patriotic spirit and purpose.... A nation’s history is
to its own people an essential force for national pride, morale
and solidarity.”<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Much of the irritation of the Germans toward “de-Americanized”
histories arose from the same source from which
sprang the dissatisfaction of the Knights of Columbus.
Their chief causes for complaint lay in the “defamation”
of the nation’s “heroic characters,” the “misrepresentation”
of “the just causes of the American Revolution” and
of “the basic principles of the Republic,” besides “innumerable
inspiring episodes in our history [being] belittled or
entirely omitted” because of “the professed interest of
Anglo-American amity.”<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>“Every true American,” asserted the Steubenites, “naturally
resents and resists the teachings in these books to our
children that ‘the President of the Continental Congress and
first signer of the Declaration of Independence was a smuggler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
with no other mention of Hancock from cover to cover,’
that Jefferson was ‘deserving of a halter,’ and that Hamilton
declared that ‘the people are a great beast.’”<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> And although
“nine revisionists give nine different sets of causes
for the American Revolution,” which are mutually contradictory
and contrary to the causes stated in the Declaration
of Independence, yet the Declaration continues to be “immortal”
and “gives the lie to all these anglicized revisions.”<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the “emasculation” of many intrinsically
essential historical “truths,” the pro-German controversialists
found cause for complaint in “the attempt to envelop
the America of today in the myth of Anglo-Saxon origin and
kinship.” Such a procedure “wrongs the colonial Germans
and Dutch of Pennsylvania and New York, the Swedes of
New Jersey and Maryland, the French Huguenots of Carolina,
the Irish of all the colonies, [and] the Jews from every
clime.”<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>A confession of kinship of interest with the Knights of
Columbus movement is freely made in the acceptance of
quotations demonstrating the “baleful propaganda.”<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
The German-Americans are one with the Irish-Americans in
their feeling of humiliation at the thought of having “the
history of our national life for one hundred and forty-four
years declared a forgery,” and in seeing “it rewritten at the
dictation of the champions of a foreign power who repudiates
the stand of their forefathers.”<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>It is precisely such a sentiment that influenced the American
Turner-Bund, formerly the American Gymnastic Union
and made up of Germans, at their annual convention in June,
1923, to endorse the movement of the Sons of the American
Revolution,—a movement inaugurated “to revise history
textbooks, ... with a view to eliminating or correcting
alleged distortion of facts.”<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> The resolution of the
Turner-Bund alleged that “many textbooks now in use contain
distinctly pro-French and pro-British statements, neglecting
throughout American history the work of the
German people in its development.”<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> The resolution further
carried the indictment of a school history which states
that “Alsace-Lorraine was stolen in 1871 from France by
Germany,” whereas, it was asserted, “France stole it from
Germany two hundred years before.”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>Besides the effort of the German-Americans “to put a
stop to the prevailing tendency to misuse our public schools
for undermining American sentiment in favor of British
colonialism,” the Steuben Society avowed as one of its purposes
the desire to “foster in American children of German
blood a proper pride of ancestry as a necessary basis of true
American patriotism.”<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Such is the intent of Frederick
Franklin Schrader in his book “<i>1683-1920</i>.” His purpose
is made clear by the following statement found in the
preface:</p>

<p>“A blanket indictment has been found against a whole
race. That race comprises upward of 25 per cent of the
American people and has been a stalwart factor in American
life since the middle of the seventeenth century. This indictment
has been founded upon tainted evidence. As is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
shown in the following pages, a widespread propaganda has
been, and is still, at work to sow the seeds of discord and
sedition in order to reconcile us to a pre-Revolutionary
political condition. This propaganda has invaded our public
schools, and cannot be more effectively combatted than by
education.” The assertion that a charge of “German
propaganda has no terrors for the author,” is also included
in the preface, for “statements of fact may be controverted;
they cannot be disproved by an Espionage Act, however
repugnant their telling may sound to the stagnant brains of
those who have been uninterruptedly happy because they
were spared the laborious process of thinking for themselves
throughout the war, or that no inconsiderable host which
derives pleasure and profit from keeping alive the hope of
one day seeing their country reincorporated with ‘the
mother country’—the mother country of 30 per cent of
the American people. It is to arouse the patriotic consciousness
of a part of the remaining 70 per cent that this compilation
of political and historical data has been undertaken.”<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>To insure this “proper pride of ancestry” it is the opinion
of the author that there should be given greater publicity to
German contributions in the making of the United States.
Among these contributions, the Germans would have it a
matter of more general knowledge that the first iron works in
this country were established by a German (Thomas Reuter
in 1716); that the first American-printed Bible was printed
by a German (Christopher Sauer in 1743); that the first
paper to print the Declaration of Independence in America
was the <i>Pennsylvania Staatsboten</i> of July 5, 1776; that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
was the Germans who first called Washington “the father
of his country”; that General Herkimer of Oriskany was of
German extraction; that Steuben formulated the principles
and regulations that governed the American army when it
was created; that Germans have contributed valuable inventions;
that Lincoln was of German descent; that Molly
Pitcher was a German; and that of the ideals of liberty and
of education the Germans were conspicuous creators.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>Nor would the Germans have the Americans forget such
incidents as the saving by Germans of American refugees
from a “bloodthirsty mob of Mexicans at the Southern
Hotel, Tampico, Mexico,” through their aid in 1914,<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> the
help of Germans in holding Fort McHenry in the War of
1812,<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and that “the German element furnished nearly
200,000 men, natives of Germany” for the Northern army
in the Civil War.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>


<h4>THE CENSORSHIP OF PATRIOTIC GROUPS, FRATERNAL
ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHERS</h4>

<p>Other agencies than the Hearst newspapers and those
groups united by religious and racial bonds have interested
themselves in attacking the histories used in the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
schools. Most active among these censors are various patriotic
organizations and individuals, notably newspaper
editors. Through such forces many investigations of textbooks
have been undertaken, resulting, at times, in the exclusion
of the books under criticism from the public schools.</p>

<p>During the World War, European history textbooks bore
the brunt of attack. Discussions tending to bestow praise
upon the Central Powers, or in any way to disparage the
institutions or prowess of the Allies, were deemed disloyal
to the cause in which the United States was engaged. Not
only were history textbooks condemned but also textbooks
in foreign language, particularly in German. The same
spirit showed itself in many avenues through which public
opinion could be affected. Thus a federal judge enjoined
the production of “The Spirit of ’76,” a film depicting the
Wyoming Massacre and Paul Revere’s ride, because it
tended “to make us a little bit slack in our loyalty to Great
Britain in this great emergency.”<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>To those who feared a diluted Americanism, it seemed
quite apparent that sinister forces were abroad, and in the
attacks made upon authors of history textbooks, it was frequently
charged that the preparation of school histories was
in the hands of German paid agents. Indeed, the activities
of pro-German forces to control the content of history textbooks,
it was alleged, had been operating for some time, and
since 1915 had been directed by Dr. Dernburg, under whom
definitely made plans had been perfected.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> This conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
was reached by the skeptical when to one of his agents
was attributed this statement: “The Americans do not love
the British, and they are inclined to like the Germans. By
controlling the preparation of school histories, we can begin
to make Americans from the time they are children see the
German point of view.”<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<p>Among the organizations which feared the inculcation of
disloyalty through a study of history as commonly written
was the Fathers of Soldiers and Sailors League. It was
through their influence that the James Harvey Robinson
histories were excluded from the schools of Des Moines,
Iowa, because of the statement regarding Germany contained
in these books.<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Among the objections raised
against Robinson’s <i>Medieval and Modern Times</i> were the
characterization of the German government, the failure to
fix the responsibility upon Germany for bringing about the
World War, and the discussion of the violation of “all laws
of humanity as well as of international law” by Germany.
In addition to criticisms directed against the 1916 edition
of this book, the Des Moines objectors felt that there was
a pro-German bias evident in the 1918 Supplement in such
a statement as the following: “So while Germany was able,
as we shall see, to conquer important portions of Central
Europe as the war proceeded, she lost all her colonies. The
question whether she is to have them back or not will be one
of the great problems to adjust at the end of the war.”<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>The same organization identified itself with a movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
in California to investigate the content of history textbooks.
In July, 1918, the State Board of Education directed that
all textbooks in American and European history appearing
upon the official list of high school textbooks be submitted
to a committee of expert historians for review, to determine
whether such textbooks were objectionable on the ground of
being pro-German or containing matter which might be
offensive to the American allies in the World War. On
September 18, the committee reported, and the following
books were stricken from the official list: Botsford, <i>A Brief
History of the World</i>, Myers, <i>Mediaeval and Modern History</i>,
and Myers, <i>General History</i>. Robinson’s <i>Medieval and
Modern Times</i>, edition of 1916, was also eliminated from the
official list, but the edition with the supplement of 1918 was
substituted upon condition that the publishers make certain
changes in the revised edition. Robinson and Beard, <i>Outlines
of European History, Part II</i>, was banned until a specified
revision should take place. Of the books examined, the
committee found no important objections to Andrews, <i>Short
History of England</i>, Ashley, <i>Early European Civilization</i>,
Cheyney, <i>Short History of England</i>, Harding, <i>New Mediaeval
and Modern History</i> (edition of 1918), Robinson and
Breasted, <i>Outlines of European History, Part I</i>, Webster,
<i>Early European History</i>, and West, <i>Modern World</i>. The
committee rendered decisions against the Myers histories
because they represented a viewpoint opposed to that of the
time. Botsford’s textbook was found objectionable because
it was “favorable to the acts of Germany and critical to an
unjust degree of the acts of the ... allied nations,” and
because it presented the causes of the American Revolution
in a “bald form.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>
<p>Other places, actuated by similar sentiments, interested
themselves in the character of history instruction. Seattle,
Washington, became the center of a controversy between the
school superintendent and the teachers on the one hand,
and two of the school directors on the other, regarding
Robinson and Beard’s <i>Outlines of European History</i>.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> As
a result of the discussion, the book was thrown out of
the Seattle schools until the expurgation and revision should
occur.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a></p>

<p>In Montana, the State Council of Defense ordered the
withdrawal of West’s <i>Ancient World</i> from circulation in all
public and school libraries, because they objected, among
other things, to an introductory statement that “the settlement
of the Teutonic tribes was not merely the introduction
of a new set of ideas and institutions ... it was also the introduction
of fresh blood and youthful minds—the muscle
and brain which in the future were to do the larger share
of the world’s work.”<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<p>Due to the same point of view and under the same compulsion,
the Commissioner of Education of Rhode Island
in 1918 undertook an investigation of the textbooks in use
in that state, and found objectionable “various text-books
designed for sixth grade history according to the report of
the committee of eight.” In a large number of books [were
found] ... “various references to the Germans which, in
the light of recent developments, are to be regarded as incorrect
or exaggerated statements....” And it was considered
“objectionable to place before the children of America
statements which are, or which will appear to them to be,
laudatory of the people with whom we are at war or adversely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
critical of our own people.”<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> The use of histories
considered “offensive” was also discontinued in the states
of Arizona, Iowa, Ohio, and Oklahoma, either through the
action of the office of the state superintendent or some other
official.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Doubtless in other states the action of local
boards brought about the same result.</p>

<p>New textbooks, syllabi and other teaching aids appeared.
Superintendent William L. Ettinger of the New York City
schools, for example, in 1918 issued a syllabus on the War
designed to aid teachers in “imparting a correct intellectual
understanding of the causes, events and issues of the war,”
as well as to help them in inspiring “the pupils with a love
for the ideals and an appreciation of the sacrifices of our
country.” For, he held that “the American Army of the
future, both men and women, are in our schools today.”
Dr. Ettinger’s letter to the Principals of High Schools declared
that “History should be taught so that a deep emotional
appeal” should be made in all topics; that “a lasting
effect” could “be produced on the ideals, purposes and
emotions of the child only by arousing deep feeling in connection
with the presentation of the subject matter.” In
the event of adding new material as the War progressed, it
was required that “all such material ... be approved by
the Principal of the School before ... used in the classroom.”<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>As in all books which were meeting the popular demand of
the time, the <i>Syllabus</i> made Germany “the only country in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
the world that was prepared and anxious for war” because
of her autocratic government, the character of the Kaiser,
militarism and navalism, Germany’s desire for world domination,
and the insidious inculcation of loyalty in the German
people through the Prussian system of education.</p>

<p>The insistence of the American people that histories in
the schools should not be in any degree “laudatory” of the
enemy peoples nor “unfavorable” to our allies in arms led
to the revision of many textbooks after April, 1917. Since
1923 these revisions, in turn, have been criticized in the
light of recently published documents relating to the origin
of the War. Although the question of war guilt is still held
by many historians as debatable, it is pointed out in <i>The
Freeman</i> for June, 1923, that probably “children have already
been indoctrinated with a theory that leaves no excuse
for uncertainty, no opening for new evidence and no stimulus
to free thought.”<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>With this condition in mind, critics have assembled their
arguments against certain textbooks in European history
found in the public schools. Because it made Germany primarily
responsible for the World War objection was raised to
<i>The Story of Human Progress</i> by Willis Mason West, an author
but a short time before criticized for pro-Germanism.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a>
Roscoe Lewis Ashley is challenged for saying in his <i>Modern
European Civilization</i> that “Germany wanted war and determined
to rule or ruin ... and a war which in the true
sense had been made ‘in Germany’ was a reality”; while
Webster, in his <i>Modern European History</i>, is criticized for
the statement that “There is no longer any need to fix the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
responsibility for the World War. That the German government
planned it and precipitated it has been made evident
by the avowal of the Germans themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>The interpretation placed upon the causes leading to the
War by Charles Downer Hazen in his <i>Modern Europe</i> has
likewise been condemned. For Hazen “summarizes the
case as follows: ‘The world was stunned by the criminal
levity with which Austria-Hungary and Germany had created
this hideous situation. The sinister and brutal challenge
was, however, accepted immediately and with iron
resolution by those who had done their utmost during those
twelve days to avert the catastrophe.’”<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> A criticism by
Professor Harry E. Barnes directed for the same reason at
the textbooks of this author provoked a spirited exchange
of opinion in the spring of 1924. Professor Hazen upheld
his interpretation as to Germany’s guilt, while Professor
Barnes asserted that such a point of view was untenable in
the light of official documents made known since the War.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>Other writers of European histories used in the schools
have not escaped. According to <i>The Freeman</i>, Robinson
and Beard, in their <i>History of Europe Our Own Times</i>, seem
to have been “more or less taken” with the plan of leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
the “readers to draw their own conclusions” in their chapter
on the origin of the War. Disapproval arose out of the
statement that “the assertions of the German leaders that
England desired war and was responsible for it are, of
course, as the rest of the world knows, wholly without
foundation in fact,” and because of the quotation from
Prince Lichnowsky indicting Germany.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, <i>Modern History</i>, by Hayes and Moon,
is given a clean bill of health because of its treatment of
this controversial subject. The critic, however, pointed out,
in fairness to the other writers criticized, that “in the
interval that has elapsed since the appearance of the other
texts ..., certain new items of evidence had been brought
forward and the general war-fever had abated somewhat.
The authors of the new book therefore enjoyed certain
special advantages, which help, no doubt, to explain the
novel tone....”<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>Not only has the treatment of the origin of the War been
a source of criticism but also the divergent points of view
regarding German atrocities, reparations and the Treaty of
Versailles. On these points Professor Donald Taft in his
study “Historical Textbooks and International Differences”
has declared that American pupils are taught from two kinds
of textbooks, one group being “bitterly anti-German” and
the other attempting a fairness of judgment. Of this he cites
Guitteau’s <i>Our United States</i> and Long’s <i>America</i> as examples.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a>
Much the same point of view is held by Isabel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
Kendig-Gill in a pamphlet “War and Peace in United States
History Text-Books,” in which, in addition, she declares
that “nowhere is there any fundamental analysis either of
the political and economic situation out of which the war
grew or of its spiritual and moral costs to the world.”<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a></p>

<p>Following the close of the World War, the place of prominence
held by the histories of Europe in the critic’s eye
was eclipsed by American histories. A desire to depict
events favorable to the Allies was superseded by the apprehension
that such a narrative would prove the undoing of
American patriotism. This apprehension was mingled in
the minds of many with the fear that the solid pillars of society
were being threatened with radicalism and socialism.
In this spirit, for example, attacks on history textbooks were
inaugurated by the editor of <i>The Daily Courier</i> of Ottumwa,
Iowa. On March 2, 1919, under the caption, “Get a New
History,” appeared an editorial attacking Muzzey’s <i>An
American History</i> because of its “socialistic trend” and its
treatment of the period since the Civil War.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> Two years
later, due to the energy of the editor of the Ottumwa <i>Daily
Courier</i>, Governor Nate Kendall of Iowa was asked by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
joint committee on Americanism of various patriotic and
civic organizations to appoint a commission “to investigate
anti-American and radical teaching in state owned institutions
and the public schools.” The action of the committee
was prompted by the information “that there were
good reasons to believe that some of the textbooks on American
History used in our schools were wanting in national
and patriotic spirit and sentiment; that they failed to instil
devotion to American ideals, and pass[ed] over lightly
events in American history which should ... stimulate
pride of country, patriotism and devotion to our institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
No action was taken by the Governor.</p>

<p>One of the most active organizations in the present-day
movement to remodel the content of history textbooks has
been the Sons of the American Revolution. In 1917 at the
instigation of the Executive Committee of the National Society
an examination of Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i>
was undertaken by Judge Wallace McCamant, later president-general
of this organization. His verdict was unfavorable;
and as a result the book was excluded from the public
schools of Portland, Oregon, and Evanston, Illinois. Although
a revised edition later appeared, this critic still
believed Muzzey a “political partisan” and his history unsuitable
for use in the public schools.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> One of the most
“grievous faults” which Muzzey committed, in the opinion
of Judge McCamant, was in his discussion of the American
Revolution, wherein he spoke “contemptuously of Hancock,
Warren, Otis and the Adamses” in calling them “patriots”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
with quotation marks attached to the word.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> He
was held equally culpable because the Revolutionary dispute
is said to have involved “a debatable question,” a statement,
which, in the critic’s mind, should disqualify him from
writing a school history.<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> Yet a reading of the statement
in its context conveys a different meaning from that suggested
by Judge McCamant, for Muzzey declares: “Until
the Declaration was published the Tories and Loyalists, of
whom there were tens of thousands in the American colonies,
were champions of one side of a debatable question, namely,
whether the abuses of the King’s ministers justified resistance;
but after the Declaration loyalty to the King of
Great Britain became treason to their country.” The reviewer
found other grievous faults in that “the author contemptuously
refers to the speeches and papers of Henry and
the Adamses as ‘their rhetorical warnings’ against being
‘reduced to slavery’”; that only one sentence is devoted to
Bunker Hill; that there is “no mention of the death of
Joseph Warren”; that there is “no reference to the gallantry
with which the Americans defended the rail fence
and the redoubt”; and only a brief mention of Lexington
and Ticonderoga. “Aside from four sentences,” only
“seven pages” are devoted “to the Revolutionary War,”
when the “students in our public schools should be taught
that our free institutions were won by heroism and sacrifice.”<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
Other omissions of “essential” facts were the
failure to describe the work of Marion, Sumter, Pickens and
Williams; no mention being made of Gansevoort, Anthony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
Wayne or Stony Point, Light Horse Harry Lee or Paulus
Hook, Bennington or John Stark.</p>

<p>Carrying the criticisms further, it was alleged that this
history contains inaccuracies and unfair statements; that it
is full of partisanship of a political character; that it gives
a biased treatment of controversial subjects; and is pro-British.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>
It was the belief of the reviewer, moreover, that
controversial subjects like the tariff have no place in a high
school textbook, for “whatever the views of a citizen may be
on this subject he should be permitted to send his children
to school without having them taught that his own views on
this question are unsound.” Characterization of Mr. Wilson’s
policies, “particularly as set forth in his ‘New Freedom’
as an economic Declaration of Independence,” also
struck a discordant note. Class distinctions are also made
conspicuous, the reviewer declared, as in such a statement
as “Federalism, which stood in John Adams’ phrase, for
government by ‘the rich, the well-born and the able’”;
and in “The failure of the South to get rid of slavery in the
early decades of the nineteenth century must be set down
to the domination of a class of rich, aristocratic planters.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>During the year 1923 the activities of the Sons of the
American Revolution became diversified to the extent that
their report on Patriotic Education dealt with several American
histories. This report was actuated by the interest that
had been shown in the “National Congress” meeting at
Springfield in May, 1922, when that body expressed a deep
interest in “the subject of American history textbooks”
and resolved that the Committee on Patriotic Education
“take needful measures to eliminate from our schools” all
objectionable textbooks.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>In their review of American histories, the Committee
found “a great deal of inaccuracy and considerable propaganda
bearing on political questions which still divide the
people.”<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> They held as “fundamental defects and those
which are most clearly subject to criticism at the hands of
a patriotic society ... inadequate and unsympathetic
treatment of the American Revolution and a treatment of
events in our recent history in such a manner as to inculcate
loyalty to class rather than to country.”<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The Committee,
furthermore, emphasized the importance of a study of an
untainted American history, one teaching “a veneration of
the great men of our past” as “the best antidote for radical
and disintegrating propaganda.” They maintained that
“the chief purpose to be subserved in teaching American
history is the inculcation of patriotism.”<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> To devote only
ten pages out of five hundred to a discussion of the Revolutionary
War laid the author open to criticism by patriotic
groups; and such inadequate treatment could not be excused
on the ground that the book was written for advanced students
who have gathered the necessary details in the elementary
grades. The works of Fiske, Schouler, Trevelyan,
and Lodge, although written for adults, discussed these details,
which, in itself, was proof of their value to the Committee
who were considering textbooks.</p>

<p>In the examination of history textbooks the Committee
found “the McLaughlin and Van Tyne, O’Hara, Everett
Barnes, Hart, James and Sanford, Muzzey and West histories
objectionable in the treatment of the American Revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>
The Muzzey, West and Burnham histories were
described also as “open to criticism on the ground of class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
hatred.” Because the objections to Muzzey’s and West’s
books were based on more than one ground for complaint,
separate criticisms were published by the Committee, which
were “widely circulated.”<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, endorsement was accorded to Gordy’s
textbook and the Thwaites and Kendall history for grammar
school use. For the high school the Committee recommended
the amended edition of Guitteau’s book and the
Halleck history.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>As a result of their agitation, according to the Report, the
Everett Barnes history had been amended and the author
had removed from it the aspersions on John Hancock. The
Committee wished to distinguish sharply, however, between
this Barnes and “the old Barnes history which has always
been sound in its Americanism.”<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> They desired also to
recommend “without qualification” the history of Dr.
Edward Channing, who at their request had signified his
willingness to make suggested changes in his textbook.
With evident approval they quoted the following statement
from William J. Long, “author of the latest history published
by Ginn and Company” in which he said: “What I
missed in our histories, especially those of recent date, was
the spirit of devotion without which the mere facts of history
have little interest or consequence to my boy and your
boy.”<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>The efforts of the national group received the active support
of many local units. Under the direction of “Compatriot
S. T. Cameron of the District of Columbia Society”
the Piney Branch Citizens’ Association of Washington, D. C.,
opened fire on Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i> for the reasons
frequently assigned, and circulated, according to Judge
McCamant, “a scholarly brief” that proved this textbook
“hopelessly unfit for school use.”<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>Among the standards which the Piney Branch Citizens’
Association set up for a textbook in American history were:
that it should assume “an unquestioning attitude toward the
sincerity, the aims or the purpose of the founders of this
Republic or of those who have guided its destinies; that
it should contain no material that tends to arouse political,
racial, or religious controversy or hatred”; that it should
“emphasize the principles and motives that were of the
greatest influence in the formation and development” of
the government; that “it must incite in the pupil ideals of
patriotic and civic duty,” as well as cultivating “an appreciation
of the hardships endured and the sacrifices made in
establishing and defending American ideals.”<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a></p>

<p>No success attending their efforts to eliminate this textbook
from the acceptable list in the Washington schools, the
Piney Branch Association continued their attack. On April
25, 1923, a public hearing was given Professor Muzzey and
his critics, at which “more than one hundred persons, including
school officials, teachers, civic leaders and interested
students ... listened attentively to the arguments pro and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
con which continued for nearly four hours.”<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> In defending
himself, Professor Muzzey declared that Mr. Cameron
had “garbled the facts and twisted phrases in a way” that
was “absolutely unfair”; that he had taken “certain words
and sentences and read them without the complete section,”
which, in many cases, put “an entirely different aspect upon
them.”<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> With Mr. Cameron, in criticizing adversely this
American history, was Charles Edward Russell of the
“Patriot League for the Preservation of American History.”
He regarded the book as “‘a grave public menace,’” and
declared that “the school children in the heart of China”
were being taught “a more accurate account of the American
revolution than those in the Washington schools.”<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, unqualified endorsement was given
the textbook by Superintendent of Schools Frank W.
Ballou. George J. Jones, head of the history department of
the Washington high schools, emphasized “the destructive
nature” of the attack and “pointed out that all of the teachers
of American history in the local high schools vouch[ed]
for its patriotism....”<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> In support of Mr. Jones were
Dr. George M. Churchill and Elmer L. Kayser, professors
of American history at George Washington University, Dr.
Charles E. Hill, professor of political science at the same
university, Dr. Leo F. Stock, professor of history at the
Catholic University, and Rear Admiral George W. Baird,
former president of the Board of Education.<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>

<p>In commenting upon this and other attacks directed
against this textbook, Carson C. Hathaway in <i>The Dearborn
Independent</i> for October 23, 1923, declared: “To Muzzey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
history is a review of <i>what</i> happened and an important
analysis of <i>why</i> it happened. To those who desire to be
thrilled by the familiar stories of our national heroes, the
text may not be satisfying. But perhaps there is enough
thrill in even an unbiased treatment of American history
to satisfy any thoughtful and patriotic American.”<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>In November, 1922, the Kentucky branch of the Sons of
the American Revolution addressed a communication to nine
educational institutions requesting the exclusion of Muzzey’s
<i>An American History</i> from the lists of approved textbooks,
because of its “flippant, inaccurate and unsympathetic”
content-matter.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> Failure to inculcate “reverence for our
Revolutionary fathers and their ideals” besides its “callous
indifference” in the treatment of battles and heroes appeared
to the Kentucky Sons characteristic of this book.</p>

<p>As a comment on their action, the <i>Louisville Times</i> editorially
remarked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If the Sons of the American Revolution in Kentucky have discovered
a public school text-book of history that is unfair to the
national record that book is lonesome. The <i>Times</i> is not familiar
with the work of Professor Muzzey of New York, which the
society at its meeting last night denounced as ‘unpatriotic, unfair,
inaccurate, partisan, closely bordering on the socialistic and
lacking in Americanism.’ But for many years in the public
schools of the United States courses have been full of text-books
on history which committed most of these crimes in reverse
order, by misstating all facts relating to the foreign controversies
of the United States and the wars fought by this nation.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Muzzey book may be all that is charged against it. If
so, it is remarkable that it was adopted in the Kentucky schools
after considerable investigation; that it was not complained of
during the inquiry into history text-books in New York; that the
University of Kentucky recommended it....</p>

<p>“But unless the book is unfair and inaccurate it should be
defended against attack. The valor of ignorance is asserting
itself in all quarters of America. Calmly content for several
generations to study histories that were grossly unfair to every
other nation in the world, some portion of the American public
have lately gotten into the book-censoring business....</p>

<p>“... The ancestors of the gentlemen who sat last night resented
nothing more than censorship of all kinds. They wanted
to settle for themselves what they should read, eat, drink, wear
and do. The era of Jefferson and Franklin and Samuel Adams
was not the era of excision and paternalism.”<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Courier-Journal</i> also, in an editorial on “Writing
History,” stressed the new values which have developed in
the scientific presentation of history, causing “a fresh and
clarified perspective.” To the <i>Courier-Journal</i> Muzzey’s
textbook represented “the newer tendencies in historical
writing,” and aimed wisely “to give the emphasis to those
factors in our national development, which appeal to us as
the most vital from the standpoint of today.” The editorial
commended it for omission of facts which could easily be
found elsewhere, and because of its non-sectionalism.<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>Action similar to that taken by the Kentucky chapter occurred
in California, where not only the Sons of the American
Revolution but the Sons of the Revolution instituted a
search for “anti-American” histories. Here the latter organization,
under the leadership of Frank H. Pettingell, in
an effort to gain converts to their point of view, distributed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
to all school districts Charles Grant Miller’s pamphlet
<i>Treason to American Tradition</i>.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> By the former organization
two detailed reports regarding Muzzey’s <i>An American
History</i> were issued, the one expressing the opinion of a
majority of a committee to investigate this book, and the
other setting forth the views of a dissenting member.</p>

<p>The majority report revealed no criticisms which had not
been presented in the National Report.<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> On the other
hand, the minority statement included four points: first,
that “fairness requires that if we are to pass upon the histories
used in the schools, there should be an examination of
those in general use, not merely one; second, if there is to
be a critical examination of histories in use in the schools of
this country, it should be by a committee composed of members
sufficiently acquainted with the writing and teaching of
history, that their report may be comprehensive and scientific,
as well as patriotic; third, the majority report fails
to consider thoroughly the purpose for which this history
was written; and fourth, the history should be judged by its
whole tone and spirit and purpose, and not by words and
sentences isolated from their context.”<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a></p>

<p>In analyzing the textbook and comparing statements with
those cited in the majority report as reprehensible, the
minority report accepted the principle adopted by some
textbook writers, namely, that biographical history should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
be left to the elementary grades and the study of institutional
development to the secondary school.</p>

<p>As a result of this agitation, the Commissioner of Secondary
Schools of California appointed a committee to
investigate history textbooks. They reported that none of
the books examined were found tainted by disloyal or unpatriotic
sentiments, and that the attacks against history
textbooks were due to a “revival of pro-German sentiment,”
to “an ineradicable Irish anti-British sentiment,” to a “journalistic
opposition to Great Britain,” and “to an element of
political reaction against the domestic legislation of recent
years.”<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>In Ohio, also, the Sons of the American Revolution at
their state convention in Cleveland in May, 1923, condemned
Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i> and adopted a
resolution that no textbook should be used in the schools
“which belittles the founders of our government or minimizes
their achievements.”<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<p>During Education Week in 1922, the Idaho Society Sons
of the American Revolution, under the leadership of Captain
A. H. Conner, started an agitation against the <i>History of the
American People</i> by Willis Mason West, resulting in the
exclusion of this book from the Boise schools. Criticized
in much the same manner as Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i>,
this textbook was held unfit to “be found in a single school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
in the United States of America.”<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> To Captain Conner,
the treatment of historical incidents, not only in the Revolutionary
period and in the War of 1812, but in the Civil War
and recent period, deserved severe condemnation.</p>

<p>Objection was raised to the treatment accorded battles in
the American Revolution and in the War of 1812, as well
as that of controversial questions which have “no place in
a history.”<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> From the latter, Captain Conner adduced
that “the author of this book is quite evidently a free
trader.” The discussion of the labor question, socialism, the
direct primary, the initiative, the referendum, the League of
Nations and other “controversial subjects,” such as were
found in this book “are out of place in a school history.”
Furthermore, it was charged that the book “excuses the
South for its disgraceful treatment of Union soldiers in
military prisons, (p. 566), states that Robert E. Lee ranks
among the noblest figures in American history and practically
accuses Grant of being in collusion with the ‘Whiskey
Ring.’”<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>Captain Conner’s criticism of West’s discussion of the
Civil War period gained ready converts to his point of view,
and the Phil Sheridan Post Number 4 of the Grand Army of
the Republic issued a denunciation of the textbook as
“worse than a travesty on justice, and a slam in the face of
true Americans.”<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>These and other efforts of the Sons of the American Revolution
to censor history textbooks have resulted in their
elimination from many lists of approved textbooks. According<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
to F. W. Millspaugh, vice-president of the Tennessee
chapter, “efforts to have certain books withdrawn from
public schools in Tennessee and Alabama have been unvaryingly
successful.”<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Muzzey’s history, according to Judge
Wallace McCamant, was excluded from the schools of
Adrian, Michigan, Murfreesboro and Nashville, Tennessee,
Florence, Alabama, and a number of schools in Kentucky,
and “all of the objectionable histories ... from the
schools of Indiana on a hearing before the textbook commission
and as a result of the attack made upon them by
the Sons of the American Revolution.”<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> According to
Captain Conner, “Muzzey’s history has been taken out of
the schools of Burley, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho Falls, Nampa
and Pocatello, and West’s history has been taken out of
Boise as a result of the activities of the National Society
acting through the Idaho Society.”<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>Although many places have barred the books under suspicion,
success has not everywhere attended the efforts of
the Sons of the American Revolution. This is accounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
for by Judge Wallace McCamant because of “the attempt
made by the educators responsible for its [a book’s] presence
to defend their action,” and because “the publishers of
these objectionable books are strongly entrenched in educational
circles....”<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a></p>

<p>But others than “the educators” and “the publishers”
have opposed the efforts of the Sons of the American Revolution
in their attempts at textbook censorship. “Individual
members” of the organization “in Rhode Island, New
Jersey, the District of Columbia, Ohio, South Dakota and
California have taken issue publicly with the work of ...
the [national] Committee.”<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> For example, the historian
of the Passaic Valley (New Jersey) chapter, in reviewing
Muzzey’s textbook, asserted that “the whole trend of the
book is to tell the logical course of events, and to explain
the causes of events,” and that there was “no ground” for
Judge McCamant’s observation that “the author has ‘no
abiding conviction in American fundamentals; no enthusiastic
veneration for the great men who founded the Republic.’”<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<p>Other dissenters from Judge McCamant’s opinion were in
general agreement with this statement, another member of
the Sons of the American Revolution suggesting that “one
must surmise that Judge McCamant came to the book determined
to be displeased.”<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<p>A mutuality of interest with the Sons of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Revolution in censoring school histories is seen in the action
of the Sons of the Revolution at St. Louis in December,
1922. Aroused by an address of Roy F. Britton, president
of the local chapter, a resolution to investigate history text-books
used in the St. Louis schools was unanimously
adopted. In Major Britton’s report to the local chapter
he expressed disapproval of Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i>
and Hart’s <i>School History of the United States</i>, books which
he himself had examined, as well as condemning Ward’s edition
of Burke’s <i>Speech on Conciliation with America</i> and
Guitteau’s <i>Our United States</i>, which he had not examined.
The last two books used in the St. Louis schools were also
classed with the “de-Americanized” histories because
“several men of prominence, apparently speaking with authority,
as well as certain patriotic societies and newspapers
have denounced” them.<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> McLaughlin and Van Tyne’s <i>A
History of the United States for Schools</i> and West’s <i>History
of the American People</i> were cited likewise as examples of
the “revisionists’ methods” according to men like Charles
Grant Miller and Charles Edward Russell.<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> Major
Britton’s efforts received the approval of some of the newspapers
of St. Louis for the “real service” he had rendered,<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>
one editorial remarking that school histories should
set forth that the American Revolution was “a tremendous
exhibit of resolution and courage to set at naught the most
powerful military and naval country of the time.”<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a></p>

<p>Other patriotic organizations have likewise attested their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
interest in the status of present-day history instruction.
The Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence,
on July 4, 1922, at their national convention,
asserted an aversion to public school histories which would
“misinterpret the men and measures, manners and methods
and the great events of the Revolution and the subsequent
periods leading up to the Constitution of 1787.”<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> The
Veterans of Foreign Wars in National Encampment on
August 24, 1922, “indignantly” protested against the
alleged un-American histories, and commended Charles
Grant Miller for his “patriotic service” in exposing and
checking “a sinister attempt to degrade our country’s
history.”<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>Similar action was taken by the New York State Department,
Grand Army of the Republic, in 1923, in demanding
the presentation of “true American history,”<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> and by the
National Society Daughters of the American Revolution in
1923.<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> The United Spanish War Veterans in annual convention
deplored the “British propaganda” found in a
school history,<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> and the Veterans of the Seventy-Eighth
Division of the American Legion at Atlantic City, in September,
1923, passed resolutions for the suppression and removal
from the schools of all unpatriotic textbooks and “particularly
history books.”<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p>

<p>These criticisms upon history textbooks impelled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
American Legion to undertake, in 1922, the writing of an
American history. This project received the endorsement of
more than fifty national patriotic societies, but the preparation
of the textbook was first entrusted to Charles F. Horne,
professor of English in the College of the City of New York
and editorial director of the American Legion. According
to Mr. Horne, the Legion had as a purpose “an absolutely
honest history ... in no sense boastful or extravagant.”<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a>
In the statement of their principles, the Legion expressed a
desire that their history “speak the truth, so that no child
learns afterwards to distrust it. But in telling the truth it
must be careful to tell the truth optimistically. It will mention
the blunders of the past so that the child learns to be
careful; but it must dwell on failure only for its value as a
moral lesson, must speak chiefly of success....”<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<p>The Legion, among other things, likewise set up as a principle
for their textbook the inspiration of patriotism. Upon
“every page a vivid love of America” must be preached.
It was their conviction that such a book should “encourage
patriotism, strengthen character, stimulate thought and impress
the worth of Truth.”<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a></p>

<p>In 1925, <i>The Story of Our American People</i> expressed in
a tangible form the aims of the Legion. Two volumes offer
solace to those whose sensibilities have been wounded by
the treatment accorded events in the American histories
most commonly used in the public schools. For the pupil
is taught that “this is the land of hope,” a land that “even
strangers love,”—looked upon by “the poor folk and oppressed
of other lands ... as a kind of paradise, ...
where work brings its best reward, the one region where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
Peace seems assured, the land of Opportunity ...” to
which even “the leaders of other countries” turn “as a land
of Power, able to help them in their political troubles, yet
not grasping at their rights.”<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>To the pupil is revealed “a Divine Purpose” controlling
the history of America for, although “perhaps the oldest
continent in the world,” America lay “unused” until the
time when “civilization should prove worthy of it.” It was
“by natural processes” that “the world of Europe was
sifted and sorted that there might be planted here some of
its richest seed,” a people who might well be “called a
‘chosen race’ of Europeans.” Among this number were
some “made desperate by Europe’s dreary lack of opportunity”;
sometimes there were “folk convicted as criminals,
but laws have not always judged men as God judges them,
and the governments of those days were apt to be harsh and
narrow.”<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>Many of the points “omitted” from other school histories
are found here. Not a few of our heroic characters such as
Betsy Ross, Nathan Hale, Molly Pitcher, “Mad Anthony”
Wayne, John Paul Jones, and Haym Salomon are given recognition.
Nor are there missing such slogans as “Don’t give
up the ship.”<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a></p>

<p>The pupil is led through “the Second War for Independence,
a story of outworn patience and of mistakes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
ended in unexpected fortune;” through the war with Spain,
“a people’s war”; and finally through the World War, in
which we were “no feeble foe to match even the terrible
German colossus.”<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>

<p>In a letter to <i>The New York Times</i> Professor Claude H.
Van Tyne, under the caption “A Questionable History,” declares
the title of this history to be “so bombastic that it
might as well be ‘The Marvelous Story of Us.’” He points
out that the pamphlet which accompanies the book lists not
only the organizations which are said to have gone over the
material and to have given it their approval, but also schoolmen
and historians “of wide repute.” “I will not say as
to the schoolmen,” said Professor Van Tyne, “but as to historians
I have looked over the entire list which is given and
I find not one historian of repute in it.... There is also
added an imposing array of senators ... some chairmen of
great national political parties, who, of course, endorse the
scheme out of pure policy.... That which was a cloud no
bigger than a man’s hand when Charles Grant Miller began
his infamous attack upon the histories written by men who
really knew the facts has become a menacing storm, threatening
truth wherever it is found.”<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a></p>

<p>According to Frank C. Cross, National Director of the
Americanism Commission in 1925, the American Legion believed
that “much of the agitation and complaint regarding
school textbooks in history has apparently come from prejudiced
sources—from men and institutions that are themselves
propagandists....” The Legion, furthermore, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
declared, do not believe that the authors who have been generally
attacked are “unpatriotic or that their books are
written as the result of organized propaganda.” Yet they
felt that some of the authors had “laid themselves open to
just criticism because they have sometimes made statements
from the point of view of a critic or investigator rather than
from that of a teacher,” that “some of these authors are at
fault in placing before immature pupils the blunders, foibles
and frailties of prominent heroes and patriots of our Nation.”
The Legion also took exception to the introduction
of “matters of controversial nature without giving adequate
space ... for presentations of the essential facts on both
sides.”<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<p>Through the activities of such patriotic groups have arisen
agitations similar to that in Dubuque, Iowa, where the local
post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars sponsored a history
textbook attack.<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Under the direction of a committee composed
of a representative of the Ladies’ Grand Army of the
Republic, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign
Wars, the Spanish-American War Veterans, the Parent-Teacher
Association, and the Superintendent of Schools,
McLaughlin and Van Tyne’s <i>A History of the United States
for Schools</i> was cast out of the public schools.</p>

<p>Still others than the patriotic societies of the United States
have censored the content of history textbooks. Among
these are the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, who have advocated the inclusion in all
school histories of some account of the place and achievement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
of the negro in this country’s development.<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> The
Ethical Society of Davenport, Iowa, would seek a substitute
for West’s <i>History of the American People</i> because it does
not depict sufficiently the contributions of countries like
Germany to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a></p>

<p>The New Jersey State Council of the Junior Order of
United American Mechanics, “representing 80,000 members
in its 1922 Convention” endorsed the work of the
Patriot League for the Preservation of American History
and demanded an “unimpaired” American history.<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a></p>

<p>Similar action was taken by the Knights of Pythias in
their Grand Lodge meeting in Trenton, New Jersey, in September,
1923, in unanimously accepting a report on history
textbooks used in the New Jersey schools and adopting a
resolution condemning “<i>A School History of the United
States</i> by Albert Bushnell Hart; <i>A History of the United
States</i> (1919) by John F. O’Hara; Burke’s <i>Speech on Conciliation
with America</i> (1919) by C. H. Ward; <i>An American
History</i> Revised (1920) by D. S. Muzzey; <i>Builders of
Democracy</i> by Edwin Greenlaw; <i>Our United States</i> (1919)
by William Backus Guitteau; McLaughlin and Van Tyne’s
<i>History of the United States for Schools</i>, revised 1919;
<i>History of the American People</i> (1918) by Willis Mason
West; <i>Short American History by Grades</i> and later condensed
into one volume and <i>American History for Grammar
Grades</i> (1920) by Everett Barnes.”</p>

<p>They further pledged their “unflagging support to the
Patriot League for the preservation of American History<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
in its plans to drive from our schools all treason texts that
have a tendency to deprive the generations yet to come of
the sacred heritages that were won by the unmatchable
sacrifices of our forefathers.” The Committee recommended
also a campaign of publicity against the condemned
histories and the appointment of committees in each “subordinate
Lodge” through whom these books were to be
“thrown out and their use prohibited.”<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

<p>In March, 1923, <i>The New Age</i> called the attention of
Masons to the criticisms raised by patriotic organizations
and by Charles Grant Miller against American histories.
Since most of the “distinguished patriots,” who were either
omitted from the textbooks or who were slightly mentioned
“with some slurring or critical allusion,” were “Masons,”
<i>The New Age</i> urged parents to look into the kind of histories
their children were using.<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a></p>

<p>In 1924 “forty-three” patriotic and fraternal organizations
of New Jersey united in endorsing the Williams school
history bill, designed to legalize the censorship of histories
in that state. These included the American Legion, the Descendants
of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence,
the Sons of the American Revolution, the Steuben
Society of America, the Grand Army of the Republic, the
United Spanish War Veterans, the Knights of Columbus,
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the Junior Order United American Mechanics,
the Knights of Pythias, and the Patriotic Order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Sons of America.<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> An exhaustive discussion of the text
books commonly attacked was issued by the New Jersey
Unit of the Patriot League in February, 1924. According
to this pamphlet the Guitteau, the Muzzey, the Barnes, the
McLaughlin and Van Tyne histories had been revised to
meet the objections raised against them, but not to the entire
satisfaction of their critics.<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a></p>

<p>Set off against the advocates of a highly nationalized history
are those interested in promoting the spirit of internationalism.
With this desire Robert Andrews Milliken
suggested the re-writing of history through the Committee
of the League of Nations on Intellectual Coöperation. The
work as projected purported not to be an attempt to reform
each nation’s textbooks but to present an impartial world
history, neither neglecting nor overestimating the achievements
of distinct national groups.<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> The same sentiment is
responsible for the advocacy of an abolition of partisan textbooks
tending to foster bitterness and hostility among nations,
which was sanctioned in June, 1923, by the Federation
of the League of Nations Society.<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a></p>


<h4>INVESTIGATIONS BY MUNICIPAL AND SCHOOL AUTHORITIES</h4>

<p>The endeavors of those who have constituted themselves
textbook censors have borne fruit in many towns and cities
of the United States. They are the source of the well-known
New York City investigation of history textbooks. In October,
1920, Superintendent William L. Ettinger appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
Associate Superintendent Edgar D. Shimer and a committee
to investigate attacks made on histories used in the public
schools. In November, 1921, the Committee presented a
unanimous report on the fundamental principles that should
govern the preparation of textbooks on history for the city
schools. During November and December, 1921, and into
January, 1922, the Committee held open session weekly to
listen to charges against histories, at which L. R. MacEagain
of the Irish Patriotic League, Charles Grant Miller, Patrick
J. Lang, Mrs. E. J. Cramer of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, Mrs. M. R. Jacobs, Abraham Wakeman,<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>
and Edward F. McSweeney of the Knights of Columbus
appeared.<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a></p>

<p>On May 12, 1922, the comprehensive report of the Committee
was adopted by the Board of Education. This document
is concerned chiefly with three matters: the establishment
of a set of fundamental principles and reasonable
standards for the writing of school histories, a detailed consideration
of the charges made against textbooks, and certain
conclusions reached as a result of the inquiry.</p>

<p>In the formulation of the “General Principles” by which
a history textbook should be written, the Committee was
doubtless guided by a letter of October 28, 1920, from Superintendent
Ettinger, in which he suggested that “a distinction
should be drawn between the obligation to cleave
closely to the line of historical truth, such as is incumbent
upon the historian writing for adult readers and the discretion
properly conceded to an author of school texts who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
writes for immature minds incapable of and disinclined to
make fine distinctions but instinctively inclined to worship
at the shrine of all that is loyal, heroic, and self-sacrificing.”
Mr. Ettinger believed it unwise to present to children facts
concerning the infirmities of men who had been inspirational
forces in national life. He objected, furthermore, to forces
which tended to destroy a reverence for the institutional life
of the country.<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a></p>

<p>In setting forth the “General Principles” for guidance in
writing history textbooks, the Committee denied to the
author “absolute freedom in the selection or in the interpretation
of historical material” because “predetermined aims
and standards predetermine selection and interpretation.”
Furthermore, the Committee felt there should not be included
in a textbook statements of a derogatory character
concerning American heroes. Material which would
tend to “arouse political, racial, or religious controversy,
misunderstanding, or hatred” they also wished
excluded.<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a></p>

<p>In the investigation, examination was made of many of the
best known textbooks in American history and government
including those by Barnes, Guitteau, Hart, Magruder,
McLaughlin and Van Tyne, Morris and West. In all of
these books the Committee found statements which were
objectionable to them, their chief disapproval arising from
the discussions of our relationship with England, especially
in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812; the
incorporation of controversial topics in the textbook; the
failure to inculcate patriotism; the emasculation of accounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
of wars for the purpose of encouraging peace; and derogatory
statements concerning our national heroes.</p>

<p>In speaking of the American Revolution, the <i>Report</i> declared:
“Throughout ... there should be but one aim: to
impress upon the pupils the sublime spectacle of thirteen
weak colonies spread along fifteen hundred miles of sea
coast, poorly equipped and poorly disciplined, giving battle
to the strongest military and naval power in the world. In
addition the Colonists were surrounded by hostile Indians
and in their midst was a large body of Tories working at
times openly, at times secretly, but, at all times against
them.... The pupil must be taught that if liberty is to
continue ‘to dwell in our midst’ he must be prepared, should
occasion arise, to make similar sacrifices.”<a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> Authors of
textbooks, the <i>Report</i> indicated, should “refrain from such
characterizations as ‘War Hawks’ or from cynical, sarcastic
or sneering remarks concerning the prosecution of the war.”
It was also felt that such a statement as Barnes made—“The
war was a mistake. It was a case in which anger
overcame judgment”—would be the generator of an unfortunate
attitude in the pupils.<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> Nor should writers indulge
in controversial discussions because “The public
schools are maintained by the public funds. The taxpayers
are of various creeds and political beliefs” and it is necessary
to respect their feelings.<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a></p>

<p>Criticism was directed toward several textbooks because
they failed “to inculcate patriotism by bringing to the
attention of the pupils the best in the lives, words and deeds
of our patriots.” According to the Committee too much
attention was given “to the utterance and achievements of
the heroes of other countries.” To those who would offer
disagreement to such a statement because it meant a “narrow-visioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
patriotism” tending to accentuate racial consciousness,
they offered the suggestion that “in the elementary
grades, our primary concern is to acquaint the
pupils with the deeds and words of our own heroes, and the
traditions of our own land.”<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Even though derogatory
statements regarding our national heroes might be statements
of fact, they asserted that “truth is no defense to the
charge of impropriety,” for it “is a solemn and sacred obligation”
to preserve “unsullied the name and fame of those
who have battled that we might enjoy the blessings of
liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>The conclusion of the Committee included, besides the
criticism indicated in the discussion of the <i>Report</i> given
above, the statement that no evidence of intentional disloyalty
had been found on the part of the authors of the
textbooks although their attitude toward the founders of the
Republic in some cases was “entirely reprehensible.” Nor
was there evidence to support the charge that the textbooks
had been written as “a result of unwholesome propaganda”
although some of the writers frankly stated that they believed
“there ought to be more friendly relations between
Great Britain and the United States, and that they had
written their histories from that standpoint.”<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a></p>

<p>Another investigation of the history textbooks used in the
New York City schools was projected in December, 1921,
under the auspices of the Hylan city administration. On
December sixth, Mayor John F. Hylan instructed David
Hirshfield, Commissioner of Accounts, to make “a thorough
investigation ... with regard to the new history readers
and text-books alleged to contain anti-American propaganda,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
which have been introduced into the schools of this
city.”<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> To the Mayor it was a matter of considerable concern
that the school children of that city should be “inoculated
with the poisonous virus of foreign propaganda which
seeks to belittle American patriots.”<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>The inquiry was begun December tenth, at which time
J. J. Shields, an insurance agent, and Charles Grant Miller
were consulted by Mr. Hirshfield.<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> According to <i>The New
York Times</i>, Mr. Hirshfield did not wish to employ experts
in his investigation, preferring men of “sound judgment”
who were “open to conviction.”<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the examination of the books under
criticism, Mr. Hirshfield held “five public hearings during
the period from February 3 to April 18, 1922, to which all
those interested were invited.”<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> Among those who spoke
were Alvin E. Owsley, National Commander of the American
Legion, who raised objections to history teaching in
which “children do not understand the facts” of American
history; Joseph T. Griffin;<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Colonel H. B. Fairfax, representing
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who was surprised
at the intimation in school textbooks that Paul Revere’s ride
was a myth; Julius Hyman, who felt that Jewish heroes like
Haym Salomon and Aser Levi should be given a place in
histories;<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> and William Pickens, a negro, who wished history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
textbooks to record the fact that the first man killed
in the Boston riot was Christmas Adams [Crispus Attucks]
a negro, that 5,000 negroes fought in Washington’s army,
250,000 in the Civil War and 400,000 in the World War.<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Francis M. Kinnicut of the English-Speaking
World and Mr. Telfair Minton of the Loyal
Coalition spoke in defense of the histories under attack.<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a>
According to Mr. Hirshfield, “representatives of the text
book publishers” were also present but “none spoke” in
defense of their books.<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a></p>

<p>In his investigation, Mr. Hirshfield examined Muzzey’s
<i>An American History</i>, West’s <i>History of the American People</i>,
Hart’s <i>School History of the United States</i>, McLaughlin
and Van Tyne’s <i>A History of the United States for Schools</i>,
Guitteau’s <i>Our United States</i>, Barnes’ <i>Short American History
by Grades</i>, and Barnes’ <i>American History for Grammar
Grades</i>.<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> All of the books were found guilty of
“promoting more friendly relations and mutual understanding
with Great Britain” to the extent that the “school
children are now being taught not the consecrated maxim,
‘Taxation without representation is tyranny,’ but, quite to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
the contrary, that ‘in England’s taxation of the colonies
there was no injustice or oppression,’ and that the real
reason independence was sought, was because after England
had at great cost crushed out autocracy in the Western
Hemisphere, the colonists no longer needed the protection
of the mother country, and were unwilling to pay their fair
share of the costs incurred.”<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hirshfield’s appraisal is not unlike that of all other
critics who allege that pro-British agencies are in control
of the writing of American history. “A determined purpose
to disregard the Declaration of Independence, breed disrespect
for the Constitution of the United States and American
institutions and belittle the great men and women
responsible for the establishing of the United States of
America” is seen in the writings of many educators who
are charged with a willingness “to be subsidized into sympathy
with the Carnegie design of ‘the reunited states, the
British-American Union.’”<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>In addition to the grievances urged against the historians
in their treatment of Anglo-American relations, Mr. Hirshfield
objected to the characterization accorded such “great
leaders” as Jackson, Monroe and Clay by McLaughlin and
Van Tyne, who with “other history revisionists show a
peculiar fondness for this unfair method of estimating the
characters of American leaders.”<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a> Among other criticisms
directed against Muzzey’s history was that of inaccuracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span><a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a>
and West’s textbook was condemned because it was written
by an “outright propagandist endeavoring zealously to promote
the British design of an Anglo-American union.”<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>In the discussion allotted by the Report to Guitteau’s <i>Our
United States</i> and the Barnes histories, Mr. Hirshfield
pointed out changes made by these authors in revisions
which have appeared since these books were first criticized.
These changes led Mr. Hirshfield to remark that “the
promptness with which ‘modern historical scholarship’
may shift itself to any attitude required is truly amazing.”<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
Mr. Barnes, especially, he charged with “mobility” of judgment,
but declared that Barnes “is only a Brooklyn school
principal and is not considered in scholastic circles of colleges
and historical associations, like some of the other
complained-of historians, who have been seduced into a
sycophantic acceptance of English authority on all things
American.”<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>The statements in the Hirshfield Report regarding school
histories bear a striking similarity to those of Charles Grant
Miller. Indeed, with but insignificant exceptions the Hirshfield
attacks on McLaughlin and Van Tyne’s <i>A History of
the United States for Schools</i>, Guitteau’s <i>Our United States</i>,
Barnes’ <i>Short American History by Grades</i> and his <i>American
History for Grammar Grades</i> are couched in the same
language as that employed by Charles Grant Miller in his
articles in the Hearst newspapers. Furthermore, the section
of the Report devoted to “British Propaganda Agencies are
Active in America” is substantially a verbatim re-publication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
of an article which appeared October 15, 1922, in the
Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i>.<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> A comparison of the
statements under the name of David Hirshfield and those
under that of Charles Grant Miller tends to verify a statement
in the <i>New York Tribune</i> which ascribes the authorship
of the Hirshfield Report to Charles Grant Miller.<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a>
Indeed, the <i>Tribune</i> in a series of articles beginning November
5, 1923, discussed in detail the Hirshfield Report and
asserted that it is “a substitute paper for a document turned
in by a reputable scholar and expert who had been expressly
commissioned at considerable expense to the city to make a
thorough survey of the books in question.”<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> According
to the <i>Tribune</i>, “coincident with holding some public hearings”
the Commissioner of Accounts “employed Joseph
Devlin, a recognized lecturer and writer on historical and
educational subjects, to examine the complained-of histories.”<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a>
Mr. Devlin, “a staunch supporter of Tammany”
and of Mayor Hylan, is said to have included in his
report on history textbooks an exoneration of the “Briticized”
historians, characterizing them as one hundred per cent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
American whose loyalty to the United States could not
be questioned.<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> Although better compilations of American
history could be imagined by Mr. Devlin, he asserted
that the historians were not guilty of the charges made,—charges
designed “to help keep bigotry, dissension and distrust
between this country and England.”<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a></p>

<p>Besides the books which the Hirshfield Report condemned
as lacking in Americanism, Mr. Devlin examined <i>A History
of the United States</i> by John P. O’Hara, <i>A History of the
United States of America</i> by Charles Morris, <i>American
Government</i> by Frank A. Magruder, <i>Builders of Democracy</i>
by Edwin Greenlaw, <i>History of the United States</i> by Charles
A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, and <i>The Making of Our
Country</i> by Smith Burnham.<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> The Magruder and Greenlaw
textbooks, Mr. Devlin pointed out, were not histories,
and the only cause for complaint which he could find against
the latter was the inclusion of “Hymn of Love for England.”
The former was described as a “plain work on
civics and government, not dealing with history at all and
free from one-sided opinion.” Regarding the Morris and
Burnham histories, Mr. Devlin found no objection. The
authors of the Beard textbook, however, he felt should be
asked to “cut out all apologies for the conduct of England,”
and the O’Hara volume, although “very well compiled,”
was open to charges of bias and a pro-Catholic viewpoint.<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a></p>

<p>Of those histories which the Hirshfield Report had condemned,
Mr. Devlin found only one which justified the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
charge of a pro-British point of view. This textbook—<i>The
History of the American People</i> by Willis Mason West—had
been banned from the New York City schools. The
McLaughlin and Van Tyne history, the Devlin Report declared,
should be revised in such a way that it would arouse
more “pride in American breasts for the part the forefathers
of our country played in freeing it from England,”
but it was not found culpable in many of the respects commonly
alleged.</p>

<p>The employment of Mr. Devlin for the purpose of investigating
history textbooks was denied by Mr. Hirshfield.
The only connection which Mr. Devlin had with the history
inquiry, according to Mr. Hirshfield, was to “list all the
textbooks, particularly as to authorship and the number of
textbooks by different authors used in the same grade of
work.” Later when “Mr. Devlin took it upon himself to
write a history report and had the audacity to submit same
to me, I dismissed him at once,” declared the Commissioner
of Accounts.<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a></p>

<p>In refutation of Mr. Hirshfield’s denial regarding his part
in the history inquiry, Mr. Devlin asserted that he began
his investigation of history textbooks on December 21, 1921,
as “an expert” through the direction of Mr. James McGinley,
Hirshfield’s “chief of staff,” and continued the work
for seven months when “the investigation was brought to a
close” due to lack of funds.<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> “Nearly a year after these
opinions had been submitted by Mr. Devlin and shelved,”
stated the <i>Tribune</i>, “the Hirshfield-Miller version appeared....”<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>The Devlin Report “being the opposite of what his employers
wanted,” remarked <i>The New York Times</i>, “...
the job was turned over to one Charles Grant Miller, who
joyously and promptly turned out, and in, a report of
just the right—meaning the desired—kind, and that
is the one, says the Tribune, which Mr. Hirshfield
signed and published, greatly horrifying a part of the
metropolitan population and as much amusing the rest
of it.”<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a></p>

<p>The Hirshfield Report stimulated much discussion
throughout the country. In New York, Superintendent of
Schools William L. Ettinger declared “that the very idea of
the Commissioner of Accounts investigating such a subject
as the teaching of history in the public schools was highly
amusing,” and that the Report was “belated and unnecessary
inasmuch as the school authorities had already
condemned seven of the eight histories condemned by
Hirshfield.”<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<p>The press in all sections of the United States devoted their
columns to the Report and to the teaching and writing of
history. The <i>Atlanta Journal</i>, under the caption of “Politician
vs. Historian,” remarked that “Mr. Hirshfield’s views
... are of no consequence. But the general reaction to his
ganderish expression of them is highly interesting and altogether
wholesome.” The <i>New York World</i>, according to the
<i>Journal</i>, suggested that “‘the standing of the historians
whom he attacks is better than his own’; while the Buffalo
News comments: ‘Instead of leaving history to educators
who are reputed to know something about it, the politicians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
are arrogating to themselves the right to determine what
texts shall, and what texts shall not, be used.’”<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a></p>

<p>“The New England view is well reflected by the Hartford
Times,” declared <i>The Journal</i>, in saying that “‘if we are
teaching history and not mythology we want our children
to acquire a critical capacity which shall enable them to
appraise the world they live in by an intelligent application
of the knowledge of the past ... if a child has been trained
to believe that between the years 1776 and 1885 all Americans
were supermen, the appearance of a Hirshfield must
come with something of a shock.’”<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> Similar sentiment
was expressed by the <i>Baltimore Sun</i> which asserted that Mr.
Hirshfield’s “jazzy little turn on the public stage would
hardly deserve notice at all if it were not for the lamentable
tendency of a few excitable citizens whom it represents.”<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a></p>

<p>To the [Fort Wayne, Indiana] <i>News Sentinel</i> “there is
something in that name Hirshfield that sounds significant,”<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a>
and to the <i>Milwaukee Journal</i> “the very intemperance”
of Mr. Hirshfield’s charges suggested that he was
“not without his own prejudices.”<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> The <i>Dubuque Telegraph-Herald</i>
ascribed Mr. Hirshfield’s fears to “an over-stimulated
imagination” or to “the close connection of his
chief, Mr. Hylan, with William Randolph Hearst,” who “is
doing his best to stir up ill-feeling between the United
States and Great Britain.”<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a></p>

<p>The reaction of historians was reflected by James Truslow
Adams in his article “History and the Lower Criticism”
in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> for September, 1923, in which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
described the advance made in historical scholarship during
the generation before the War. “Since then, however,” he
declared, “the forces of reaction and obscurantism seem to
have been let loose and to have gathered fresh strength....
Partly because it [history] uses the language of the common
man, the common man constitutes himself a judge of its
truth, and we have the spectacle of a municipal commissioner
of accounts attacking the validity of the scholar’s
work while a town chamber of commerce defends it.”</p>

<p>“What then of the future?” queried Mr. Adams. “Is
the writing of popular history to be an effort to discover and
to disseminate among the people the true story of mankind
in the past, or is it to be written as an ethical or political
tract, to further the passionate conflicts of the present?”
The desire of the historian to portray the truth and to be
just in his estimates, is to Mr. Adams a surety that “the
patriot need fear no danger to the ideals and inspiration to
be derived from an ever more painstaking scrutiny of the
history of the colonies and of the nation. The historian
who most loves truth is most likely to love his country.”<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a></p>

<p>Other cities have passed through experiences similar to
that of New York, but less publicity has attended the investigations.
On October 23, 1922, the City Council of Boston
“unanimously passed an order requesting the School Committee
to give a hearing for the consideration of certain
objections made to the use in the public schools ... of
‘School History of the United States,’ revised 1920, by
Albert Bushnell Hart; Burke’s ‘Speech on Conciliation,’
edited by C. H. Ward 1919, and ‘American History,’ by
D. S. Muzzey.”<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>In compliance with this request the School Committee
“personally examined the books under discussion with considerable
care....” They also had prepared “a careful
and dispassionate review under the direction of all of the
Board of Superintendents of all or substantially all of the
criticisms made against these books and brought to their
attention, and a refutation of these criticisms which, in
the opinion of the Committee, justice to the authors
demands.”<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a></p>

<p>Although the Committee were not “in entire sympathy
and agreement with all the statements which the books contain,”
nor in complete accord regarding the emphasis placed
upon “certain events in our national history,” yet they felt
that “such differences” were not “sufficient to warrant the
condemnation of the books nor the impeachment of the sincerity
and good faith of the authors.”<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a></p>

<p>A “hearing” regarding the textbooks under examination
was arranged for and held by the School Committee and the
City Council on November 15, the latter being represented
by one member. “In the course of the hearing,” stated the
Report, “irrelevant and extraneous matters were brought
to the attention of the School Committee to which it listened
with scant patience.” What the School Committee regarded
as “unwarranted and ill-founded attacks were made upon the
authors of these books,” whereas to the Committee “the real
and only question at issue” was whether their [Muzzey’s and
Hart’s] histories contain material to which reasonable and
proper objection may be made.<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> In the opinion of the
Committee “no historian had ever succeeded in writing a
book which met satisfactorily every point of view, nor does
any history place an equal amount of emphasis upon all the
topics which it discusses.” Besides, “it is clearly impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
that one brief volume should give adequate treatment to all
the steps incident to the origin and growth of a great
nation.”<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a></p>

<p>The Committee also deplored “the course pursued by the
critics of these books in tearing from their context detached
sentences and omitting explanations and summaries which
are essential to a grasp of the authors’ real meaning.” Such
a procedure, they believed, would permit a critic to find an
“opportunity for criticism of any book that ever has been
written on the subject of history, and indeed on many other
subjects as well.”<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a></p>

<p>After having given “due consideration to the matter,” the
School Committee therefore were of the opinion “that the
criticisms against these two books” did not justify “their
exclusion from the Authorized List.”<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> A dissenting
opinion, however, was issued, which, “while in agreement”
with the Report, nevertheless set forth the view that the
Board of Superintendents should ask for certain changes in
the books when they were revised.<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a></p>

<p>In the comprehensive reviews of Hart’s <i>School History of
the United States</i> and Muzzey’s <i>An American History</i>, the
Committee pointed out that the chief sources of the criticisms
were taken from “Mr. Charles Grant Miller,—Treason
to American Tradition; Mr. Wallace McCamant,—Review
of Muzzey’s American History; Mr. James A.
Watson,—Speech before the Boston City Council and
interview reported in the Boston Globe of October 24,
1922, ... and from the ‘Report on History Text Books
used in public schools of the City of New York, 1922.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>In examining each statement which had been quoted to
prove that these textbooks were Anglicized editions, the
Committee showed that the “apologetic attitude toward
England” charged by the critics could not be so considered
when quotations were taken in their entirety.</p>

<p>In concluding their reviews, the Committee declared,
“Both writers have shown a striking sense of proportion,
great skill in focusing attention upon what is vital, and
commendable courage in calling attention to weaknesses and
mistakes in our history, some of which still need to be corrected.
The few defects of these books are insignificant as
compared with their many excellencies. Both books mark
an advance in the writing of history texts for school use.
Both are worthy contributions to the study and teaching of
American history. Neither of them should be excluded from
our schools.”<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a></p>

<p>Because of alleged un-Americanism West’s <i>History of the
American People</i> was banned from the approved lists of text
books in Alta, Iowa, and Jackson, Minnesota.<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a> The
McLaughlin and Van Tyne history received like treatment
in Battle Creek, Michigan.<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> From the San José (California)
Carnegie Library Hart’s <i>Formation of the Union</i>,
his <i>National Ideals Historically Traced</i>, and Van Tyne’s
<i>American Revolution</i> were removed by orders of the library
board, who declared them “un-American and unfit for reading,
particularly by school children.”<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> <i>The Study of the
Nations</i> by Harriet Tuell was prohibited in the schools of
Somerville, Massachusetts, because of alleged pro-British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
leanings. The attacks against this book culminated in a
bill in the Massachusetts Senate, in 1921, forbidding its use
in any school of the commonwealth, but the bill died in
committee.</p>


<h4>PUBLIC OPINION REGARDING THE CENSORSHIP OF
HISTORY TEXTBOOKS</h4>

<p>These endeavors to censor history textbooks have occasioned
much discussion by the press, by educators and
others. To <i>The New York Times</i> “however commendable
these efforts to find and set forth the historical truth may be,
and however honorable and sincere the motive, it must be
admitted by all that this is not the way to ‘rewrite
history.’”<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a></p>

<p>To the [New York] <i>Evening Globe</i> “the controversy over
school histories is largely between defenders of doctrine and
defenders of free inquiry, between those who do not believe
that children can be trusted with the truth and those who
believe that they can. Most of the modern histories have
been written by scholars inspired by the scientific spirit and,
therefore, no more tender with myths about history than a
modern bacteriologist with myths about disease.... A
true American history need not rob us of the story of Paul
Revere or the reverence for George Washington, but it will
teach that personal anecdotes are not the life of a nation,
that great men as well as mean men flourish in every
generation....”<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a></p>

<p>The reaction of teachers engaged in the public schools is
much the same as that of the press. The continued agitation
regarding histories carried on in Washington, D. C., led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
High School Teachers’ Association to adopt the following
resolutions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is resolved that the questioning of the Americanism of
teachers of history in American schools is resented, that the
teachers themselves should be the judges of the content of the
courses, and that the object of teaching history is to give the truthful
picture of the past, with due regard to the age of the pupil
for whom the work is intended, and therefore the truth should
not be distorted for any purpose whatever; both sides of a
controversial question should be presented from an academic
point of view so that the students of history shall be trained in
habits of open-minded tolerance.”<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Further evidence of a rebellion against the censorship attempted
over history textbooks was manifested at the annual
meeting of the Association of History Teachers of the
Middle States and Maryland in May, 1923, when a series of
resolutions was unanimously adopted “deploring an agitation
based on either ignorance or malice, or which has for its
object the promotion of animosities between classes of nations; ...”<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a>
In October, 1923, the Washington State
Teachers’ Association resolved:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1. That decisions regarding textbooks should be made by those
scientifically trained; 2. That teachers who show a lack of judgment
in the interpretation of texts, or whose loyalty is questioned,
should be disciplined, or dismissed by their own school board.
There should be no blanket charge against the whole corps.
3. That no unbiased committee of examiners has, on investigation,
substantiated the attacks made on History teaching
in American schools. 4. That examination will show that the
groups making these attacks have no understanding of the distinction
between grade and high school history, no conception of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
the methods of teaching, nor of the necessary content of an
American history. 5. That a cursory examination of the attacks
appearing in newspapers and originating with organizations prove
much of their charge is based on half quotations and a wrenching
of sentences from their context. These display an entire lack
of the American quality of fair play.”<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The objection of historical scholars toward present-day
censorship of history textbooks voiced itself at a meeting of
the American Historical Association in December, 1923,
when the following resolutions were adopted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>, there has been in progress for several years an agitation
conducted by certain newspapers, patriotic societies, fraternal
orders, and others, against a number of school text-books
in history and in favor of official censorship, and</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>, this propaganda has met with sufficient success to
bring about not only acute controversy in many cities but the
passage of censorship laws in several states, therefore</p>

<p>“<i>Be it resolved</i> by the American Historical Association, upon
the recommendation of its Committee on History Teaching in the
Schools and of its Executive Council, that genuine and intelligent
patriotism, no less than the requirement of honesty and sound
scholarship, demand that text-book writers and teachers should
strive to present a truthful picture of past and present, with due
regard to the different purposes and possibilities of elementary,
secondary and advanced instruction;—that criticism of history
text-books should therefore be based not upon grounds of patriotism
but only upon grounds of faithfulness to fact as determined
by specialists or tested by consideration of the evidence;—that
the cultivation in pupils of a scientific temper in history and the
related social sciences, of a spirit of inquiry and a willingness
to face unpleasant facts, are far more important objectives than
the teaching of special interpretations of particular events;—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
that attempts, however well meant, to foster national arrogance
and boastfulness and indiscriminate worship of national
‘heroes’ can only tend to promote a harmful pseudo-patriotism;
and</p>

<p>“<i>Be it further resolved</i>, that in the opinion of this Association
the clearly implied charges that many of our leading scholars are
engaged in treasonable propaganda and that tens of thousands
of American school teachers and officials are so stupid or disloyal
as to place treasonable text-books in the hands of children
is inherently and obviously absurd;—and</p>

<p>“<i>Be it further resolved</i>, that the successful continuance of
such an agitation must inevitably bring about a ruinous deterioration
both of text-books and of teaching, since self-respecting
scholars and teachers will not stoop to the methods advocated.”<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The sentiment of other educators is much the same as
that of writers of history and the history teacher. Professor
William C. Bagley has declared that “an official public or
governmental censorship over history text-books would be
a calamity of the first magnitude.”<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> To Dean Percy R.
Boynton “the hue and cry about American histories for
schools is a piece of post-war hysteria.”<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> In general, the
attitude of educators can be summarized in the words of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Dr. Payson Smith of Massachusetts: “The public school
does not owe to business interests or to special interests or
to labor interests of any kind that there shall be constructed
in the minds of the young people attitudes and opinions designed
to be definitely and specifically helpful to those interests....
It is not a legitimate part of the public
school program to deal in any phase of propaganda. Let
the doors of the school-house once be opened to the appeals
of those who want ... any subject taught from the special
viewpoint of a group of people and they must remain open
until the schools will be so crowded with the teachings of
the propagandists that there will be no time or opportunity
left for doing the work which is the primary responsibility
of the schools.”<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_637" href="#FNanchor_637" class="label">[637]</a> In an article, “The Anger of the Anglophiles,” Edward F. McSweeney
of the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission discussed the
“Anglo-Saxon myth.” In his discussion he ascribes to Gibbons the point
of view that an “over emphasis upon Anglo-Saxonism is positively harmful
to Anglo-Saxon solidarity, that it is a stimulus to the enemies among
Americans of friendship with Great Britain,” [and] “that the idea that a
better understanding with Great Britain can be effected by rewriting our
history textbooks be abandoned.” Gibbons, however, points out means of
bringing about “the better understanding” by “creating an irresistible
public opinion.” <i>Columbia</i>, April, 1922, p. 10.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_690" href="#FNanchor_690" class="label">[690]</a> The <i>New York American</i>, November 4, 1923. The article for which
apology was offered appeared in the issue of April 1, 1923, under the caption
of “U. S. Histories made up of British Slanders.” The article criticized
certain characterizations of heroic characters in American history as: “Englishmen
of that day believed sincerely that the Revolution was the work
of a group of ‘soreheads.’ George Washington, as a youth, had been
refused a coveted commission in the British Army. Sam Adams’ father
had been ruined by the wise British veto of a Massachusetts ‘Land Bank.’
The older Otis had failed to secure an appointment on the Massachusetts
bench. Alexander Hamilton was a penniless and briefless law student with
no chance for special advancement unless by fishing in troubled water.”
The statement of the <i>American</i> follows in part: “The fact is, that the paragraph
referred to immediately preceded the following qualifying paragraph:
‘All this of course as an explanation of the part played by Washington,
Adams, Otis and Hamilton, was as absurd as was the view of many Americans
that high-minded men like Chief Justice Oliver and Governor Hutchinson
of Massachusetts were loyalists simply to cling to office and salary. But
had the British charge been true, what greater condemnation could be
devised for the old colonial system than that under it George Washington
could not get a petty lieutenant’s appointment and that a genius like
Hamilton had practically no chance for advancement unless taken up by
some great gentlemen.’” West, Willis Mason, <i>History of the American
People</i> (Boston, 1918).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_691" href="#FNanchor_691" class="label">[691]</a> Chicago <i>Herald and Examiner</i>, April 20, 1924. According to Mr.
Miller the McLaughlin and Van Tyne textbook, among other “corrections” made, included in the latest edition “Nathan Hale, who had been omitted
entirely ... as one who ‘risked all for his country’s cause.’” These
authors also have, according to Mr. Miller, “improved the picture of
Patrick Henry” by describing him thus: “A hitherto unknown country
lawyer, but a sincere lover of liberty.” “Such corrections and many others
in this one book and all the innumerable corrections that have been made
in five other texts can have but one significance,” concluded Mr. Miller.
“The Anglicized authors have come to realize that the American people
will not tolerate Anglicized histories in our public schools.”</p>

<p>In the hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee to repeal the charter
of the German-American Alliance in 1918, it was revealed that this organization
had endeavored to control history textbooks. In conjunction
with the Ancient Order of Hibernians in America in 1907, the Alliance had
resolved “to recommend a systematic investigation of the share all races
have had in the development of our country, in war and in peace, from the
earliest days, as the basis for the founding and continuance of an unbiased
American history.” In the testimony it was declared that it was their
purpose “to give credit where credit is due” because “in all of our current
school histories, and most others, ... the Anglo-Saxon has been glorified
and exalted to the exclusion of those others who did so much for this
country, like the Irish and the Germans and the other countries.” “Hearings
before the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary, United

objection was raised to a chapter on the World War which he had written
for a high school textbook and that his publishers (the American Book
Company) had been warned that such would be “considered obnoxious,”
and that “the organization no doubt would feel itself obliged to actively
oppose the use of such a book in any school anywhere in any state.” <i>Ibid.</i>,

<p>In 1917, an investigation of the most commonly used textbooks in
history was made by Timothy T. Lew to determine the treatment given
Chinese-American relations. Mr. Lew’s conclusion was that the attitude
of Americans toward the Chinese was likely to be one of indifference
or prejudice because of the lack of attention given in textbooks, or because
many events which would show cordial relations had been overlooked.

book is a clearly conceived and a closely written argument for socialism

A letter under date of July 11, 1923, from H. C. Weber, Superintendent
of Schools at Nashville, Tennessee, stated that he was not informed regarding
the results of a complaint against a textbook used in the Nashville
schools which had been presented to the legislature. In Nashville, Tennessee,
the High School used James and Sanford’s <i>American History</i> for the past
two years according to a statement from the Superintendent of Schools.
In Adrian, Michigan, West’s <i>History of the American People</i> was the textbook
according to a “Directory of Adrian Public Schools, 1923-1924.”
W. F. Weisand, Superintendent of Schools of Nampa, Idaho, informed the
author in a letter of November 19, 1923, that for the years 1923 and 1924,
Beard and Bagley, <i>History of the American People</i> and Beard, <i>History of
the United States</i> were used. Muzzey’s history was still in use in November,
1923, according to the superintendents of schools at Burley, Idaho, and in
Idaho Falls, Idaho. This information was obtained in personal letters from
the Superintendent of Schools. It does not agree with Captain Conner’s
statement.</p>

<h4>4. <span class="smcap">Patriotism</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Article 26-C</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Instruction in Patriotism and Citizenship</i></p>

<p>Section 705. Courses of instruction in patriotism and citizenship.
In order to promote a spirit of patriotic and civic service
and obligation and to foster in the children of the state moral and
intellectual qualities which are essential in preparing to meet the
obligations of citizenship in peace or in war, the regents of the
university of the state of New York shall prescribe courses of
instruction in patriotism and citizenship, to be maintained and
followed in all the schools of the state. The boards of education
and trustees of the several cities and school districts of the state
shall require instruction to be given in such courses, by the
teachers employed in the schools therein. All pupils attending
such schools, over the age of eight years, shall attend upon such
instruction.</p>

<p>Similar courses of instruction shall be prescribed and maintained
in private schools in the state, and all pupils in such schools
over eight years of age shall attend upon such courses. If such
courses are not so established and maintained in a private school,
attendance upon instruction in such school shall not be deemed
substantially equivalent to instruction given to pupils of like age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
in the public schools of the city or district in which such pupils
reside. (Added by L. 1918, ch. 241, in effect April 17, 1918.)</p>

<p>706. Rules prescribing courses; inspection and supervision;
enforcement. The regents of the university of the state of New
York shall determine the subjects to be included in such courses
of instruction in patriotism and citizenship, and the period of
instruction in each of the grades in such subjects. They shall
adopt rules providing for attendance upon such instruction and
for such other matters as are required for carrying into effect
the objects and purposes of this article....</p>


<h4>5. <span class="smcap">The Flag</span></h4>

<p class="center"><i>Article 27</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>The flag</i></p>

<p>710. Purchase and display of flag. It shall be the duty of the
school authorities of every public school in the several cities and
school districts of the state to purchase a United States flag, flag
staff and the necessary appliances therefor, and to display such
flag upon or near the public school building during school hours,
and at such other times as such school authorities may direct.</p>

<p>711. Rules and regulations. The said school authorities shall
establish rules and regulations for the proper custody, care and
display of the flag, and when the weather will not permit it to
be otherwise displayed, it shall be placed conspicuously in the
principal room in the school house.</p>

<p>712. Commissioner of Education shall prepare program. 1. It
shall be the duty of the Commissioner of Education to prepare,
for the use of the public schools of the state, a program providing
for a salute to the flag and such other patriotic exercises as may
be deemed by him to be expedient, under such regulations and
instructions as may best meet the varied requirements of the
different grades in such schools.</p>

<p>2. It shall also be his duty to make special provision for the
observance in the public schools of Lincoln’s birthday, Washington’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
birthday, Memorial day and Flag day, and such other
legal holidays of like character as may be hereafter designated
by law when the Legislature makes an appropriation therefor.</p>

<p>713. Military drill excluded. Nothing herein contained shall
be construed to authorize military instruction or drill in the
public schools during school hours.</p>


<h4>6. <span class="smcap">Textbooks</span></h4>

<p><i>Article 25</i>, Section 674. Textbooks containing seditious or
disloyal matter. No textbook in any subject used in the public
schools in this state shall contain any matter or statements of any
kind which are seditious in character, disloyal to the United
States or favorable to the cause of any foreign country with which
the United States is now at war. A commission is hereby created,
consisting of the commissioner of education and of two persons to
be designated by the regents of the university of the state of
New York, whose duty it shall be on complaint to examine textbooks
used in the public schools of the state, in the subjects of
civics, economics, English, history, language and literature, for
the purpose of determining whether such textbooks contain any
matter or statements of any kind which are seditious in character,
disloyal to the United States or favorable to the cause of any
foreign country with which the United States is now at war. Any
person may present a written complaint to such commission that
a textbook in any of the aforesaid subjects for use in the public
schools of this state or offered for sale for use in the public
schools of this state contains matter or statements in violation of
this section, specifying such matter or statements in detail. If
the commission determine that the textbook against which complaint
is made contains any such matter or statements, it shall
issue a certificate disapproving the use of such textbook in the
public schools of this state, together with a statement of the reasons
for its disapproval, specifying the matter found unlawful.
Such certificate of disapproval of a textbook, with a detailed statement
of the reasons for its disapproval, shall be duly forwarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
to the boards of education or other boards or authorities having
jurisdiction of the public schools of the cities, towns or school
districts of this state, and after the receipt of such certificate the
use of a textbook so disapproved shall be discontinued in such
city, town or school district.</p>

<p>Any contract hereafter made by any such board of education or
other school authorities for the purchase of a textbook in any
of such subjects, which has been so disapproved, shall be void.
Any school officer or teacher who permits a textbook in any of
such subjects, which has been so disapproved, to be used in the
public schools of the state, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(Added by L. 1918, ch. 246, in effect April 17, 1918.)</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Report</span></h4>

<p>In the opinion of your Committee none of these texts treat
“any part of American history in a disloyal or unpatriotic
manner.” All of the authors may be credited with a desire to
assist in inculcating a loyal and patriotic Americanism....
Before attempting that judgment it has seemed necessary to agree
upon a statement setting forth what we consider to be the essentials
of “the best patriotism of American tradition....”</p>

<p>Possibly our effort to summarize and state these essentials has
no place in this report, since it was in effect but a preliminary
step necessary to a common point of view in examining the texts.
Nevertheless our summary is here offered both as an indication of
our procedure and as containing the points upon which the texts
were judged.</p>

<p>In our opinion the “best patriotism of American tradition,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
when conveyed by history textbooks should directly aid in
establishing certain principles and ideals in the pupil’s mind. The
more important of these we will list as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Pride in America and a Sense of Nationality.</p>

<p>A belief that America has developed a high type of political
and social organization. But recognition that these are not now
and never have been perfect and that they are a result of growth,
largely anticipated by the framers of our government, to meet
changing conditions. This requires a critical treatment of history,
pointing out both excellencies and defects, whether in men or in
events. It should help the pupil to develop a habit of just criticism,
but also, what is equally important, a habit of giving high
approval where merited.</p>

<p>(2) A Sense of Individual Liberty.</p>

<p>The recognition that America has contributed to world development
the theory that human happiness is best secured by guarding
individual liberty and by seeking to provide in the highest degree
possible an equal opportunity to win that happiness. The history
text should develop the origins with us of this ideal, in religious
controversies, political quarrels with the mother country in colonial
times, industrial development, and in political and social
changes at home.</p>

<p>(3) A Respect for Private Property.</p>

<p>Inherited from old world institutions but emphasized more than
by other nations from our earliest times. This is a bed-rock
American principle, but as developed in the United States emphasis
always has been placed on the opportunity to acquire property
as essential to individual liberty seeking happiness, not alone on
the right to defend and to protect it. It is a principle essential to
the American conception of, and contribution to, a progressive
betterment of Society....</p>

<p>(4) A Belief in Democratic Self-Government by Majority
Rule.</p>

<p>This asserts the Jeffersonian doctrine that rule by the majority,
while not insuring perfection, is more likely to approach it than
any other form of rule, and more likely to preserve individual
happiness under law. America, more than any other nation,
made the contribution of the ideal of democracy by majority
rule to the theory of political government....</p>

<p>(5) Obedience to Law.</p>

<p>Since it has its sanction in majority rule, thus providing a
reasonable limitation on individual liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>(6) A Desire for Justice.</p>

<p>It has long been, and still is, a marked attribute of America,
and history texts should expound it. They should show its
manifestations (or at times the lack of it), (a) in the spirit of
compromise that minorities may not be oppressed by majorities;
(b) in our relations with other countries; (c) in our industrial
disputes. Especially in foreign relations the text should seek
to present fairly the view opposed to American contention in
order that the justice of our action may be weighed.</p>

<p>(7) A Will to Defend these Principles.</p>

<p>This is an essential result of American history teaching which
should bring out the sacrifice, devotion and patriotism of Americans
in the past as regards: (a) our relations with other nations;
and (b) our domestic relations, either political, religious or social.
But in neither field should old and dead controversy be treated in
such a way as to perpetuate animosities....</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, the text should seek to be strictly unbiased as regards
both expression and content. It should narrate truthfully the important
facts of American history in such a way as to make clear
the principles and ideals which have been developed in America
and for which she stands.</p>

<p>Examining the texts submitted, it can not be said that any one
of them neglects, absolutely, these principles of “the best patriotism
of American tradition.”...</p>

<p>Your committee wishes further to point out the progressive
nature of history teaching in the schools of California. The high
school does not attempt to cover the same ground in American
History courses as the elementary, nor in the same manner. It
is left to the elementary schools to emphasize especially the biographical
element, while the high school texts develop the institutional
side of our nation’s growth. Hence we commend the
omission by some authors of many names of those who have contributed
something worth while to American progress, but whose
deeds and significance can best be presented by the elementary
school text. This leaves room for the high school text to include
those matters of social and economic development which are
essential to give our young people the proper historical background
for understanding our present complex problems.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>Your committee finds no text wholly objectionable under the
instructions of the State Board of Education. This is not to
say, however, that in our opinion the texts are equally worthy.
They vary in exactness of statement, in clearness of presentation,
in grasp of principles, and, what is more serious, in fairness of
language and view....</p>

<p>With this report approving all of the texts submitted to us,
further comment may be regarded as superfluous. It seems to us,
however, that we have a duty in directing your attention to the
apparent sources of some of the attacks on various texts. During
the recent World War you appointed a committee (upon which
two of the members of your present committee also served) to
examine all history texts in use in the California schools with
instructions to report whether they “were pro-German or were unduly
friendly to our allies.” All of the American history texts then
reviewed were reported as approved, but with some minor criticisms
made privately to the publishing firms or authors. It
appears to your present committee that many of the attacks now
being made on certain texts are emanating from persons or organizations
dissatisfied with the friendly relations established between
America and our allies in the great war, and desirous of
destroying that better understanding created by the war. Some
of the attacks appear to be due to a revival of pro-German sentiment;
some to an ineradicable Irish anti-British sentiment; some
to an element of political reaction against the domestic legislation
of recent years; some of journalistic opposition to Great Britain.
Generally the method used in such attacks is to print sentences
objected to without including the context. This deprives the
reader of the opportunity to judge whether the criticism is just or
not. Such criticism is in itself unfair and unscientific. A book
must be judged by its general tone and spirit rather than by
isolating words or phrases from their context and thus conveying
a false impression of the author’s meaning.</p>

<p>The point which we would make is, that attacks of this nature,
though requiring consideration, are not worthy of serious respect,
since usually they conceal real motives under the mantle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
“traditional American patriotism.” It is an age of propaganda
and in substance most of these attacks are propaganda, having an
ulterior purpose. Honest criticism by one who sincerely feels
that a text fails to teach American patriotism should always be
listened to and his criticisms weighed. But propaganda criticism
deserves no respect either by school boards or the authors of
texts. As to such propaganda assertion that any American history
text now in use in California high schools and junior colleges
“treats any part of the American history in a disloyal or unpatriotic
manner, or minimizes the best patriotism of American
tradition,” your committee reports in the negative.</p>

HISTORY TEXTBOOKS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK,<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> 1922</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">General Principles</span></h4>

<p>The formulation of aims and standards by the Commissioner of
Education denies, by necessary implication, that the writer of a
textbook for use in the public schools has absolute freedom in the
selection or in the interpretation of historical material. Predetermined
aims and standards predetermine selection and interpretation.</p>

<p>The textbook must contain no statement in derogation or in
disparagement of the achievements of American heroes. It must
not question the sincerity of the aims and purposes of the founders
of the Republic or of those who have guided its destinies.</p>

<p>The textbook must contain no material which tends to arouse
political, racial, or religious controversy, misunderstanding or
hatred.</p>

<p>The textbook must contain no material tending to arouse misunderstanding
or hatred between the United States and any
other nation.</p>

<p>The selection of material must be restricted to that which contributes
most directly and essentially to the attainment of the
legitimate objectives of the public school system as formulated
by the State Commissioner of Education.</p>

<p><i>The writer must be prepared at all times to “come out in the
open and cheerfully and unhesitatingly stand up and make known
to the entire community,” the aims and the ideals, the purposes
and the motives, which actuated him in the selection of his material
and in his interpretation thereof.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Specific Aims</span></h4>

<p>1. To acquaint the pupils with the basic facts and movements,
political, industrial, and social, of American history.</p>

<p>2. To emphasize the principles and motives that were of
greatest influence in the formation and development of our
government.</p>

<p>3. To establish ideals of patriotic and civic duty.</p>

<p>4. To awaken in the pupil a desire to emulate all praiseworthy
endeavor.</p>

<p>5. To emphasize the importance of weighing permissible evidence
in forming judgments.</p>

<p>6. To present the ethical and moral principles exemplified in
the lives of patriotic leaders.</p>

<p>7. To inspire in the pupil an appreciation of the hardships
endured and the sacrifices made in establishing and defending
American ideals.</p>

<p>8. To develop in the pupil a love for American institutions
and the determination to maintain and defend them.</p>

<p>9. To bring the light of reason and experience to bear on
radical or alien theories of economic and political systems.</p>

<p>10. To enable the pupil to interpret the present in terms of the
past and to view intelligently the functions and the value of
existing institutions.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Discussion of General Principles and Special Aims</span></h4>

<p>In order to give a clearer and more definite idea of the scope
and intent of the general principles and special aims formulated
by the Committee we submit herewith a discussion of said general
principles and special aims.</p>


<h5>A. <i>The Primary Problem in Writing a History Textbook Is Propriety
Of Selection of Material</i></h5>

<p>... As the pages of a textbook are limited, no material should
be used unless it is essential and of the highest educational value.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
The child’s time must not be taken up with facts which do not
measure up to this standard.</p>


<h5>B. <i>The Textbook Writer Is Not A Historian</i></h5>

<p>Strictly speaking the textbook writer is not a historian. The
historian writes for the open market. He has the privilege of
selecting and organizing his material in accordance with his own
views. He may be an impartial writer or he may be a partisan.
The textbook writer has not this freedom. He is subject to the
limitations imposed upon the teacher....</p>

<p>It is for the teacher to determine what material is needed. It
is for the textbook writer to supply it. Unfortunately, an examination
of the prefaces in various textbooks shows that some textbook
writers do not take this view....</p>

<p>We believe that a textbook writer who seeks to influence our
international relations is a propagandist. Under our constitution
it is for the federal government, in the first instance, to determine
what our foreign relations shall be. The children in
attendance in our public schools must not be used directly or
indirectly to influence official action in such matters.</p>


<h5>C. <i>The Burden Of Proof Rests Upon Him Who Makes A
Derogatory Statement</i></h5>

<p>As a rule derogatory statements have little or no educational
value.... Only when a man has been guilty of an act of great
moral turpitude is a discussion of his act likely to lead to beneficial
consequences. Nero’s cruelty and Arnold’s treason are
illustrations....</p>


<h5>D. <i>Probable Reason For The Presence Of Much Of The Material
To Which Objections Have Been Made</i></h5>

<p>Probably the factor principally responsible for the presence of
objectionable material in the textbooks under investigation is
that the writers have not divided their material into topic-units,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
and have not formulated aims, sufficiently extensive in scope to
permit marshalling the facts in due subordination....</p>


<h5>E. <i>Emasculated Accounts Of Wars In Order To Encourage Peace</i></h5>

<p>Objection has been made to the treatment in some of the
textbooks of the wars in which we have been engaged. The
objections are to the effect that the accounts are emasculated.
In reply it is strenuously urged that “the surest way to end war,
is to sing the praises of peace and to say little of war and the
heroes of war.”...</p>

<p>War in defense of freedom or in vindication of righteousness,
justice and equity should be vividly portrayed, and the praises
of its heroes should be joyously sung. Thus only can we raise
a citizenry willing to die for the country.</p>


<h5>F. <i>Our Heroes</i></h5>

<p>Objection has been made that some of the textbooks contain
statements in derogation of our national heroes. In reply it has
been urged that the statements are true, and that attention should
be called to the weaknesses of our heroes or we will esteem them
too highly.</p>

<p>Truth is no defense to the charge of impropriety....</p>

<p>The assurance that posterity will hold our heroes in grateful
remembrance is one of the most powerful incentives to heroic
achievement. To preserve unsullied the name and fame of those
who have battled that we might enjoy the blessings of liberty,
is a solemn and sacred obligation....</p>


<h5>G. <i>Propaganda</i></h5>

<p>It has been charged that some textbooks contain propaganda.
In reply some have alleged that all who make the charge are persons
opposed to friendly relations with Great Britain. The reply
cannot be sustained, as appears from the following editorial in
“<i>The American Legion Weekly</i>” of October 7, 1921:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The country has known for some time that school textbooks
on American history are being revised on the theory that the
elimination or correction of obvious untruths or distorted truths
concerning England’s relations with this country, notably during
the Revolutionary War, would promote the cause of international
friendship.... If the purpose of some of the authors was not
to give the lasting impression to the school children of this country
that the Revolutionary War was an unjustifiable war, that is
likely to be the effect of their work.... It will be regretted if
what appeared to be a meritorious undertaking has been exploited
with propaganda which every fair-minded American must resent.”...</p>
</div>


<h5>H. <i>Controversial Topics</i></h5>

<p>As far as possible, the writer of a textbook should avoid controversial
topics. The public schools are maintained by the public
funds. The taxpayers are of various creeds and political beliefs.
Their feelings must be respected....</p>


<h5>I. <i>Patriotism</i></h5>

<p>It is objected that some of the textbooks make no attempt to
inculcate patriotism by bringing to the attention of pupils the
best in the lives, words, and deeds of our patriots; and that in
some of the books, too much attention is given to the utterances
and achievements of the heroes of other countries.</p>

<p>In reply, it is urged that true patriotism does not require that
we magnify our country at the expense of others; that a “narrow-visioned”
patriotism means that the Englishman will become
more English, the German, more German; and the American,
more American.... Patriotism is not “egotism.” To make
certain that the pupils in the elementary grades are thoroughly
familiar with our own heroes before we introduce them to the
heroes of other lands is neither “narrow-visioned” nor evidence
of “international hatred.”...</p>

<h3 id="app_d"><i>D.</i> REPORT OF AND REVIEW ON CERTAIN TEXT
BOOKS IN HISTORY USED IN THE SCHOOLS, AND
ORDER RELATING THERETO [City of Boston]<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a></h3>



<p>The following was presented:</p>

<p>On October 23, [1922] the City Council unanimously passed
an order requesting the School Committee to give a hearing for
the consideration of certain objections made to the use in the
public schools of this city of “School History of the United
States,” revised 1920, by Albert Bushnell Hart; Burke’s “Speech
on Conciliation,” edited by C. H. Ward 1919; and “American
History,” by D. S. Muzzey. The preface to the Ward edition
of Burke’s “Speech on Conciliation” was found to be in certain
respects objectionable, and the book therefore has been dropped
from the list.</p>

<p>In compliance with this request the School Committee appointed
for a hearing the late afternoon of Wednesday, November
15, and in response to a further request that the hearing be in the
evening rather than in the afternoon in order to meet the convenience
of the members of the City Council, the hour was
changed to 8 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> on that day. The City Council was
represented at the hearing by one of its members.</p>

<p>The School Committee believes that extreme care is taken to
avoid the inclusion upon the so-called Authorized List of any
unfit or improper books for use in the public schools, and whenever
in the past it has appeared that any books to which reasonable
objections may be made have been so included prompt steps
have been taken to discontinue the use of such books. This
course will be followed in the future as carefully as in the past.</p>

<p>The School Committee welcomes all honest and fair-minded
criticism of any of its acts, and particularly when such criticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
is helpful and constructive. It does not welcome criticism that
seeks merely to tear down or destroy and does not substitute for
the object of attack something that is better and more useful.</p>

<p>The members of the Committee have personally examined the
books under discussion, with considerable care, both before and
after the hearing. They feel, therefore, that they are reasonably
well acquainted with the contents of the books and with the objections
that have been urged against them. They have also had
prepared a careful and dispassionate review under the direction of
the Board of Superintendents of all or substantially all of the
criticisms made against these books and brought to their attention,
and a refutation of these criticisms which, in the opinion of
the Committee, justice to the authors demands. The review is
hereto appended.</p>

<p>Neither this report, nor the accompanying review should be
construed as indicating that the members of the Committee are
in entire sympathy and agreement with all the statements which
the books contain, nor that proper and balanced emphasis has
been placed in all instances upon certain events in our national
history. Opinions on this point must necessarily and widely
differ and cannot be brought into absolute reconcilement, but
such differences certainly are not sufficient to warrant the condemnation
of the books nor the impeachment of the sincerity and
good faith of the authors.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the Committee, also, there are in the books
examples of what might be called “loose writing,” one single
instance of which must suffice.</p>

<p>Professor Hart says “the only way to find out what races composed
the white population (in 1790) is to examine the family
names and they show that about five-sixths were descended from
English ancestors; one-twelfth were Scotch, Scotch-Irish, and
Irish; ...; [<i>sic</i>] about one-twentieth were Germans, and about
one-fiftieth were Dutch.”</p>

<p>We think this is not a correct historical statement to make.
True, reliable statistics are, of course, hard to obtain, but it is
surely not correct to say that the only way to find what races<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
composed the white population at that time is to examine the
family names. For instance, the names of two hundred members
of the Charitable Irish Society of this city, a society formed in
1737, have been called to our attention, who were members of
that society prior to 1790 and most of them prior to 1770, and
who would not, if Professor Hart’s standard obtained of judging
from names alone, very likely be considered by him as Irish.</p>

<p>In the course of the hearing irrelevant and extraneous matters
were brought to the attention of the School Committee to which
it listened with scant patience. The question at issue was the
fitness or the unfitness of two books for use in the public schools.
In the course of the hearing, what the School Committee regards
as unwarranted and ill-founded attacks were made upon the
authors of these books. The life of Professor Hart, the service
of his two sons in the World War, and his ancestry forbid any
suspicion of his loyalty and patriotism. The life of Professor
Muzzey and his ancestry, with its record of honorable service in
the Civil War, in the War of 1812, and at Lexington, equally forbid
any belief that he would be subservient to foreign influence.
Any hint or suggestion that either of these gentlemen was influenced
to promote British propaganda especially by pecuniary
recompense is unthinkable. Nor is their reputation and standing
as reliable historians to be impugned by such criticism as is now
levelled against them.</p>

<p>The real and only question at issue is whether their histories
contain material to which reasonable and proper objection may
be made. It goes without saying that no historian has ever succeeded
in writing a book which met satisfactorily every point of
view, nor does any history place an equal amount of emphasis
upon all the topics which it discusses. One history may deal
mainly with the social and economic growth of a nation; another
with its military or naval exploits; another may dwell at length
upon the personal achievements of its great figures; another upon
its political development. It is clearly impossible that one brief
volume should give adequate treatment to all the steps incident
to the origin and growth of a great nation. Therefore, the list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
authorized for use in the public schools contains not merely a
single book, but many histories all differing in their treatment of
the subject, and these books are, of course, largely supplemented
by the personal instruction and guidance of the teacher.</p>

<p>If the books in question contain so much that is objectionable
and unpatriotic, it is singular that some of our great body of
intelligent and patriotic teachers have failed to discover these
grave defects, and that the books have had so little apparent
effect upon the loyalty of the pupils who have had access to
them.</p>

<p>The School Committee also deplores the course pursued by the
critics of these books in tearing from their context detached sentences
and omitting explanations and summaries which are essential
to a grasp of the authors’ real meaning. The critic who
pursues such a course may easily find opportunity for criticism of
any book that ever has been written on the subject of history,
and indeed on many other subjects as well.</p>

<p>In the course of the hearing certain passages in these books
were attacked on the ground that they gave an unfavorable impression
concerning the character and actions of a few of the
great party leaders of the time; but it must not be forgotten that
in such instances the authors have merely noted the opinions of
opposing party leaders.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, the pupils in our schools are perfectly well
aware of the severe, pointed and frequently virulent criticism that
is constantly being directed against men now in public life. Acquainted
with this criticism, is it reasonable to expect them to
believe that the leaders of our country in past years were really
super-men or demi-gods, and not equally subject to the weaknesses
and frailties that surround human life today? Even the
revered Abraham Lincoln was the target, in his time, of abuse and
vilification. Nor did Washington himself escape the calumnies
of some of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>As to the omission of what the critics regard as adequate mention
of former national heroes, such as Nathan Hale, Anthony
Wayne, Putnam, Sumter, Pickens, Marion, Stark, Sullivan, Knox,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
Commodore Barry, Sergt. Jasper, Light Horse Harry Lee, Molly
Pitcher and Betsy Ross: It should not be forgotten that the
exploits of these patriots, important, brilliant and picturesque
as they were have been repeatedly emphasized in the course in history
during the earlier years of the pupils’ school life while these
two books are adapted to use of older pupils.</p>

<p>The School Committee would gladly express its opinion item
by item on the various specific criticisms that have been made
against these books were it not for the fact that to do so would
unduly lengthen this report. They are covered in detail in the
accompanying review.<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a></p>

<p>The main and controlling question at present issue is this:
Does either of these books contain matter which is unpatriotic,
disloyal or calculated to falsely impress the minds of the pupils
to whom they are made accessible? If they do, their further use
in the schools should not be permitted. If they do not, there is
not good and sufficient reason to justify their exclusion and the
consequent reflection upon the sincerity and good faith of their
authors.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten moreover that these books are in
constant process of revision and correction as errors and misstatements
are discovered, and this is true probably of the works of
all historians of standing and repute.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out also that those who advance these criticisms
do not suggest the titles of other books which they would
regard as unobjectionable. On this point they are absolutely
silent.</p>

<p>The School Committee, therefore, having given due consideration
to the matter, is of the opinion that the criticisms against
these two books are not sufficient to justify their exclusion from
the Authorized List, and directs that the City Council be so
informed.</p>

<p>The undersigned, while in agreement with the foregoing report,
is, nevertheless, of the opinion that the Board of Superintendents
should see that in any future revision of these two books certain
statements therein contained, which this report and the accompanying
review do not approve, are omitted or modified by the
authors or publishers.</p>

<p>Part I of the report reveals that a serious threat is menacing
our public education system, which, however, is not working
itself out so much against the means of education, such as the
courses of study and the text books used, as against the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
part of our educational system, namely, the great body of teachers.
Responsibility for this threat devolves mainly upon a group
of extra-educational associations, such as the National Association
of Manufacturers, National Industrial Conference Board,
“America First” Publicity Association, and others. Their influence,
however, is being partially counteracted by public-spirited,
progressive educational organizations. Safeguards and remedies
are at the disposal of the organized labor movement individually
and in coöperation with the progressive educational associations
to reform the situation. This section concludes with a description
of the many organizations active in the field of public education
endeavoring to exert an influence upon it.</p>

<p>Part II brings out the true significance of the social studies in
relation to the history, achievements, aims and ideals of the labor
movement. It emphasizes, based upon scientific data, the place
of the labor movement in the social sciences. Its great significance
in modern society is thus clearly established. The opinions
and judgments of our most eminent progressive educators are
cited in support of these findings, having been secured by special
inquiry. This section also reveals that the extent to which these
studies which properly deal with the labor movement are being
taught is entirely inadequate. Progress, however, has been made
in recent years in the extension of the social sciences in our public
schools. Nevertheless, very much still must be done. In fact,
the whole public educational system, if the ideals of humanity as
expressed by the labor movement, are to receive adequate consideration
in public education, will require reconstruction around
the social studies.</p>

<p>Part III deals with the importance of the text book in teaching
the social studies. It describes the basis upon which the tests
were formulated by means of which the text books covered in this
report were evaluated. The summary of these evaluations are [<i>sic</i>]
then presented, together with a résumé of the chief criticisms of
the texts scrutinized. In all, 123 text books—47 histories, 47
civics, 25 economics, and 4 sociologies—were evaluated. The
tests bring out that one-half of the books (55 per cent) are of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
newer type, dealing with the broader aspects of government and
the social and industrial life of the people, rather than with forms
of organization, military events and abstract theories. Still, a
larger proportion (60 per cent) recognized to a greater or less
degree the power for growth in our institutions; are dynamic
rather than static in their methods of treatment. In dealing with
questions of particular interest to labor there is a great divergence
in concept as well as in method of treatment. The older formal
texts either omit these subjects entirely or treat them so unsatisfactorily
that for all practical purposes they might just as well
be omitted. Some of the more modern ones deal with them briefly
and perfunctorily, but on the whole the newer type of text does
attempt to give the labor movement in the problem of industry
adequate and just consideration. Failure to do so is apparently
due to ignorance of the author or to a hesitancy to deal with this
difficult subject, rather than to a deliberate attempt to keep the
facts of industry out of the schools. Although numerous cases of
error, misleading statements, misplaced emphasis, discrimination
against unions, and use of obsolete material, may be pointed out.
The survey finds no evidence that text books are being used for
propaganda purposes. The publishers, the report considers, are
undoubtedly deserving of a great deal of credit for keeping school-books
free from propaganda, and to this spirit of fair-play and
desire for truth it considers that the organized labor movement
may look for help in the correction of erroneous, misleading or
unfair statements which mar the pages of otherwise excellent
texts.</p>

<p>Concerning the text books in use, the report points out that
not only is an increasing supply of the better books becoming
available, but there is also a steadily increasing demand for them.
The investigation made also reveals the fact that, especially in
civics and history, the modern or more approved text is being
used to a larger extent than the less satisfactory. Subjects discussed
or investigated in supplementary courses of study such as
Current Events, the report indicates, pay a great deal of attention
to problems and matters of special interest to labor....</p>

<p class="center">An Act To create section 40.36 of the statutes, relating to textbooks
used in the public schools.</p>

<p><i>The people of the state of Wisconsin, represented in senate
and assembly, do enact as follows</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 1.</span> A new section is added to the statutes to be numbered
and to read: 40.36 (1) No history or other textbook shall
be adopted for use or be used in any district school, city school,
vocational school or high school which falsifies the facts regarding
the war of independence, or the war of 1812 or which defames
our nation’s founders or misrepresents the ideals and causes for
which they struggled and sacrificed, or which contains propaganda
favorable to any foreign government.</p>

<p>(2) Upon complaint of any five citizens filed with the state
superintendent of public instruction that any history or other
textbook which is being used in any district school, city school,
vocational school or high school contains any matter prohibited
by subsection (1) of this section, the state superintendent shall
fix a time for a public hearing upon such complaint, which shall
be not more than thirty days from the date of filing said complaint,
and shall be conducted either by the state superintendent
or the assistant state superintendent, or by one of the state inspectors
of schools, to be designated by the state superintendent,
and which hearing shall be held at the county seat of the county
where the complainants reside. Notice of such hearing shall be
given at least ten days prior to the date thereof through the public
press and by registered mail to the complainants, the school board
interested and to the publishers of such textbook.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>
<p>(3) Within ten days after such hearing the state superintendent
shall make a finding upon such complaint. If he finds that
any textbook contains matter prohibited in subsection (1) of this
section, he shall make note of such finding in the list of textbooks
which he is required by paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of
section 40.35 annually to publish and to transmit to all county
and city superintendents. No such textbook shall thereafter be
placed on the list of textbooks which may be adopted, sold or
exchanged in this state.</p>

<p>(4) Every school board, board of education, board of vocational
education, or county board of education which has control
over the textbooks used in any district school, city school, vocational
school, or high school, shall cause any textbook which the
state superintendent has found contains matter prohibited in
subsection (1) of this section to be withdrawn from use in such
school prior to the opening of the school year following the publication
of such finding of the state superintendent. No state aid
under the provisions of sections 20.25, 20.26, 20.27, 20.28, 20.29,
20.33 and 20.335 of the statutes shall be paid for the support of
any district school, city school, vocational school or high school
during any year in which any such textbook is used in such
school after the finding of the state superintendent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span> This act shall take effect upon passage and publication.</p>

<h3 id="app_g"><i>G.</i> THE AMERICAN LEGION SCHOOL HISTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES IS TO FOLLOW THESE LINES:<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></h3>
</div>


<p>1. It is meant for a textbook to teach history, not literature
nor the meaning of words. Hence, it must be simple, easily read
in the upper grades of Grammar Schools, that is, by boys and girls
from twelve to fifteen. It must fit their intelligence. <span class="allsmcap">AVOID INFLATED
WORDS: EXPLAIN UNKNOWN IDEAS.</span></p>

<p>2. It must inspire the children with patriotism, must preach
on every page a vivid love of America. It must <span class="allsmcap">BELIEVE</span> in our
land, and make others believe in it. It must believe in democracy.
<span class="allsmcap">SPEAK WARMLY; HAVE ENTHUSIASM</span>.</p>

<p>3. It must build up character. It must emphasize that our
ancestors accomplished great deeds, and thus strengthen the
children to attempt brave deeds themselves. It must tell of noble
things and praise them. Hence it should preserve the old patriotic
legends, though pointing out where these are legends rather
than facts. <span class="allsmcap">PRESERVE THE LEGENDS; PRAISE NOBLE DEEDS.</span></p>

<p>4. It must speak in an earnest spiritual strain, believing in
God; and not being afraid to mention Him, though of course
never in a sectarian way. It must not rouse religious or racial
hatred or distrust. It must create a confidence in righteousness
and decency. <span class="allsmcap">ENCOURAGE FAITH; BUILD HIGH SELF-RESPECT.</span></p>

<p>5. It must speak the truth, so that no child learns afterward
to distrust it. But in telling the truth it must be careful to tell
truth optimistically. It will mention the blunders of the past so
the child learns to be careful; but it must dwell on failure only
for its value as a moral lesson, must speak chiefly of success.
<span class="allsmcap">EMPHASIZE EFFORT AND SUCCESS, NOT FAILURE.</span></p>

<p>6. It must be non-partisan. It must give each State and Section
full space and value for the achievements of each, not centralize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
on any one section. It must give each political party
praise for what the party has accomplished, but praise none unduly
by belittling others. <span class="allsmcap">CARRY NO PROPAGANDA.</span></p>

<p>7. It must <span class="allsmcap">INTEREST</span> the children. Too little emphasis has
perhaps been laid on this point. A few facts made living will
last with the child; a mass of unattractive detail is soon forgotten.
Keep lists of things for an appendix. <span class="allsmcap">DEAL WITH PEOPLE RATHER
THAN THINGS.</span></p>

<p>8. As it is to be studied by as many girls as boys, it must
interest girl students. It must bring out the womanly side, must
mention women, their inspiration to their men, their deeds of
devotion as well as their material accomplishments. <span class="allsmcap">ENLARGE THE
WOMAN PART.</span></p>

<p>9. As the students have already heard of Columbus, Washington,
etc., the text must allow for this. It must avoid repeating
obvious things; but it must gather all the child’s odds and ends of
historical knowledge into one complete view, a sustained narrative.
<span class="allsmcap">MAKE A COMPLETE PICTURE.</span></p>

<p>10. In brief, the book is intended to encourage patriotism,
strengthen character, stimulate thought and impress the worth
of <span class="allsmcap">TRUTH</span>.</p>


<h4><i>Arrangement and Make-Up</i></h4>

<p>The book will be so arranged that it can be furnished in two
volumes (dividing at the year 1789) to fit the seventh and eighth
years of school work as usually organized.</p>

<p>The paragraph headings are to be in themselves a brief outline
of the story; and no other material, such as notes, etc., shall be
allowed to break the narrative flow.</p>

<p>Mechanical make-up is to follow the established text book
standards as to size, spacing, typography, color and paper to
prevent eye-strain. The binding is to be attractive and durable;
and the illustrations will be a special feature.<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a></p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Statement of Principles of the American Legion for the Writing
of their American History Textbook, as well as their Attitude
toward present-day Textbooks</i><a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a></p>

<p>1. To acquaint the pupils with the basic facts and movements,
political, industrial and social, of American History.</p>

<p>2. To emphasize the principles and motives that were of
greatest influence in the formation and development of our government.</p>

<p>3. To establish ideals of patriotic and civic duty.</p>

<p>4. To awaken in the pupil a desire to emulate all praiseworthy
endeavor.</p>

<p>5. To emphasize the importance of weighing permissible evidence
in forming judgments.</p>

<p>6. To present the ethical and moral principles exemplified in
the lives of patriotic leaders.</p>

<p>7. To inspire in the pupil an appreciation of the hardships
endured and sacrifices made in establishing and defending American
ideals.</p>

<p>8. To develop in the pupil a love for American institutions
and the determination to maintain and defend them.</p>

<p>9. To bring the light of reason and experience to bear on
radical or alien theories of economic and political systems.</p>

<p>10. To enable the pupil to interpret the present in terms of the
past and to view intelligently the functions and the value of
existing institutions.</p>

<p>In brief, the attitude of The American Legion toward current
history texts is set forth by the following report on history
investigation:</p>

<p>The committee on history investigation, at the time this report
was written, had about half completed their investigation.</p>

<p>Much of the agitation and complaint regarding school textbooks
in history has apparently come from prejudiced sources—from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
men and institutions that are themselves propagandists and
who use this method of checking their own un-American sentiments.</p>

<p>The formal complaints published after “investigation” have
been by men apparently incompetent to sit in judgment on historical
data. For example, the Commissioner of Accounts of
New York City. We believe that there are a sufficient number of
thoroughly competent educational experts who can pass on such
matters without calling in a Commissioner of Accounts.</p>

<p>We do not believe that such men as Muzzey of Columbia University,
West of the University of Michigan [<i>sic</i>], Hart of
Harvard, McLaughlin of Chicago University, Van Tyne of the
University of Michigan, Guitteau, Director of Schools, Toledo,
are unpatriotic or that their books were written as the result of
organized propaganda.</p>

<p>We believe, however, that the authors have laid themselves
open to just criticism because of the fact that they have sometimes
made statements from the point of view of a critic or
investigator rather than from that of a teacher. Their work is
thus perhaps legitimate for the advanced student and investigator
but not in our opinion for the public school pupil.</p>

<p>We believe also that some of these authors are at fault in
placing before immature pupils the blunders, foibles and frailties
of prominent heroes and patriots of our Nation. History should
be taught with a view to inspiring our boys and girls with love
of country and admiration for noble ideals. If a pupil is led to
believe that a great National hero was guilty of weakness and
crime he is likely to excuse such failings in himself and others.
School texts should not belittle men who have given their lives
for their country even if it should be discovered by experts that
they have been subject to ordinary human frailties.</p>

<p>We believe too that some of the writers have been guilty of
introducing matters of controversial nature without giving adequate
space (which in the nature of the case they could not do)
for presentation of the essential facts on both sides. In some
instances the author’s own personal views in such subjects seem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
to be exploited. An example is the treatment of the tariff in some
of the text books.</p>

<p>Material is sometimes presented to give critical results of recent
historical research, rather than to influence good citizenship. The
list of fundamental principles of The American Legion History
given above states our ideas of the matter which should be presented
and the method of its presentation.</p>

<p>With regard to subjects that may be internationally controversial,
such as the American Revolution, it should be borne in
mind that a good majority of the colonists supported the Revolution
and had firm faith in the rectitude of their conduct and that
almost all of our people have since believed that they were right,
and we do not believe that it is in the interest of good citizenship
to have that faith called in question.</p>

<p>We believe that much of the criticism against so-called pro-Anglican
statements is prompted by pro-German sentiments. For
example the objection to referring to England as the mother
country. The Colonists themselves used this term. The objection
seems to be purely captious and in a line with a recent agitation
to create another language than the English as the language of
America.</p>

<p>While we do not believe in glorifying war we believe that some
of our great National victories and our National heroes should
be written up in a more inspirational manner than is done in some
histories. We are confident that this will be accomplished in The
American Legion History now being written.<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_927" href="#FNanchor_927" class="label">[927]</a> According to a statement in the <i>Boston Herald</i>, May 7, 1926, the
Legion withdrew its support, June, 1925, due to opposition within its membership,
when it abrogated its contract with the United States History
Publishing Company. As a result, they were “to receive no financial benefit
from the sale of the history; permission, however, was granted to the
company to carry on its title page the fact that the book was prepared at
the suggestion of the American Legion.” A letter to the author, May 13,
1926, from the Assistant National Director, Americanism Commission, however,
declares: “The Legion has not retracted in its position relative to this
history.... The only change made is that the National Executive Committee
annulled the arrangement whereby the Legion was to receive a percentage
from the sale of these books. The United States History Publishing
Company is a private concern.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Committee on American Citizenship</i>, “Our Citizenship Creed.”<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a></p>


<p>1. I am living under a government—and am myself a part
of such government—wherein at least an elementary knowledge
of the nature and principles of this Government must be generally
diffused among the great mass of its citizens. I therefore believe
it to be my duty to inform myself on American history, the foundations
of our Government as embodied in the United States
Constitution, and the application of the principles therein contained
to present-day problems.</p>

<p>2. Since ours is a government of, for, and by the people, it
is by the very same token a government of and by public opinion.
It is, therefore, my duty, as a good American citizen, to help
form public opinion in the community in which I live in order
that all citizens may hold intelligent, just, and humane views on
governmental questions and endeavor to have such views embodied
in our laws.</p>

<p>3. Since popular government is shaped in the first instance
by the exercise of suffrage, it is one of my primary duties as a
good American citizen to cast my ballot in all local, state and
national elections and to urge my fellow-citizens to do the same.</p>

<p>4. Since ours is “a government of laws and not of men,” and
since an orderly government can exist only through laws justly
administered and impartially enforced, I declare it to be my duty
as a good citizen to serve as a juror whenever summoned, and to
use my influence in every proper way to the end that lawyers,
judges and jurors so conduct the administration of justice as to
entitle the law and the courts to popular approval and support.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span></p>
<p>5. I believe that we Americans have the best government that
has ever been created—the freest and the most just for all the
people—and that it is my duty to uphold and defend this Government
at all times. I believe that just as the “Minute Man of
the Revolution” was ready upon a moment’s notice to defend his
rights against foreign usurpation, it is my duty as a patriotic
American to be a “Minute Man of the Constitution,” ready at all
times to defend the long-established and cherished institutions of
our Government against attacks, either from within or without,
and to do my part in preserving the blessings of liberty for which
my revolutionary forefathers fought and died.</p>

<p>6. I believe that as a good American citizen I must maintain
continuously a civic consciousness and conscience; that my country
needs my active service in times of peace no less than in war;
that patriotism must be a constituent part of my religion; that no
prouder boast can emanate from my lips than truly to declare,
“I am an American citizen,” and that as an American citizen the
Constitution of the United States ought to be as actual a part
of my life and of my religion as the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
